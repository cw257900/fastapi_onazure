Business.Our MissionImprove people\u2019s lives with the world\u2019s best transportation.OverviewLyft,  Inc  (the  \u201cCompany\u201d  or  \u201cLyft\u201d)  started  a  movement  to  revolutionize  transportation.  In  2012,  we  launched  our  peer-to-peer  marketplace  for  on-demandridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United Statesand Canada.We believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (\u201cTaaS\u201d). Lyft is at the forefront of this massivesocietal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the \u201cLyft App\u201d) in cities across the United States and in selectcities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing driversusing our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is amassive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.We are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the\u201cLyft  Platform\u201d)  that  powers  rides  and  connections  every  day.  We  leverage  our  technology  platform,  the  scale  and  density  of  our  user  network  and  insights  from  asignificant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. We\u2019ve also taken steps to ensure our network iswell positioned to benefit from technological innovation in mobility.Today, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (\u201cLight Vehicles\u201d)for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want torent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership.We generate substantially all of our revenue from our ridesharing marketplace that connects drivers and riders. We collect service fees and commissions fromdrivers for their use of our ridesharing marketplace. As drivers accept more rider leads and complete more rides, we earn more revenue. We also generate revenue fromriders  renting  Light  Vehicles,  drivers  renting  vehicles  through  Express  Drive,  Lyft  Rentals  renters,  Lyft  Driver  Center  and  Lyft  Auto  Care  users,  and  by  making  ourridesharing marketplace  available  to organizations  through our Lyft Business offerings, such as our Concierge and Corporate Business Travel programs.  In the secondquarter of 2021, we began generating revenues from licensing and data access agreements, primarily with third-party autonomous vehicle companies.We  have  made  focused  and  substantial  investments  in  support  of  our  mission.  For  example,  to  continually  launch  new  innovations  on  our  platform,  we  haveinvested heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community,cultivate a differentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerfulmultimodal platform and scaled user network.Notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, we are continuing to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses.

Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments  and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions  and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.Although we have seen some signs of demand improving, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of the pandemic, demand levels continue to beaffected by the impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. The extent to which our operations will continueto be impacted by the pandemic will depend largely on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new informationwhich may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authorities and private businesses to contain the pandemicor recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has caused many businesses to delay employees returning tothe  office,  which  in  turn  reduces  levels  of  demand.  Even  as  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders  are  modified  or  lifted,  we  anticipate  that  continued  socialdistancing, altered consumer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us. The strength and duration ofthese challenges cannot be presently estimated.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have adopted multiple measures, including, but not limited, to establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing  and  updating  workplace  policies.  We  also  made  adjustments  to  our  expenses  and  cash  flow  to  correlate  with  declines  in  revenues  including  headcountreductions in 2020.For more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of Part I.

Our key growth strategies include our plans to:\u2022Increase Rider Use Cases. We  are continuously working to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offerproducts to simplify travel decision-making, for example with our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services anduniversity safe rides programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions, such as our Concierge offering, that enable organizationsto manage the transportation needs of customers, employees and other constituents.\u2022Grow Active Riders. We  see opportunities to continue to recoup and grow our rider base amid the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. We may make incrementalinvestments in our brand and in growth marketing to maintain and drive increasing consumer preference for Lyft. We may also offer discounts for first-time ridersto try Lyft or provide incentives to existing riders to encourage increased ride frequency. We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace byattracting and retaining more drivers on our network to deliver the best possible service levels. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate ways to expand ournetwork  coverage  beyond  the  geographies  and  markets  we  currently  serve.  We  also  believe  we  are  a  beneficiary  of  demographic  shifts,  such  as  the  growingpercentage of the U.S. population that is accustomed to on-demand services and has digital-first preferences.\u2022Grow Our Share of Consumers\u2019 Transportation Spend. Lyft\u2019s  transportation network is designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. The Lyft networkspans rideshare, car rentals, bikes, scooters, transit and vehicle services. By integrating the fragmented transportation ecosystem, we are well positioned to deliverthe best holistic experience to all of our riders and to capture significantly more of our market opportunity.\u2022Deliver  Increasing  Value  to  Drivers. We  strive  to  provide  drivers  that  use  Lyft  with  the  best  possible  experience,  including  access  to  the  best  economicopportunities. For example, through our Express Drive program, drivers can get access to rental cars they can use for ridesharing. We\u2019ve also been investing in ourDriver  Centers,  Mobile  Services  and  related  partnerships  that  offer  drivers  affordable  and  convenient  vehicle  maintenance  services.  By  making  the  driverexperience better and better, we can retain and attract more drivers to Lyft\u2019s network.\u2022Invest in our Marketplace Technology. Our  investments in our proprietary technology allow us to deliver a convenient and high-quality experience to drivers andriders.

Every driver is required to pass a professionally administered background check before they drive and each year after that.\u2022Ongoing  criminal  monitoring.  Continuous  criminal  monitoring  allows  us  to  quickly  deactivate  drivers  with  disqualifying  criminal  convictions.  We  also  checkdriving records throughout the year to promptly identify and remove disqualified drivers from the platform as soon as a violation is detected.\u2022Mandatory safety education.  Drivers must complete a safety program developed with RAINN, the largest anti-sexual violence organization in North America.These  programs  can  vary  by  state  and  cover  topics  such  as  how  to  create  a  safe  and  comfortable  ride,  appropriate  conversation  topics,  respecting  personalboundaries, and recognizing and reporting sexual assault and sexual misconduct.\u2022Emergency help, supported by ADT. If  a rider or driver feels uncomfortable or needs emergency assistance at any point, they are able to quickly connect with anADT security professional.\u2022Hidden contact information and ride history. The  Lyft App hides contact information for both the rider and driver before, during and after the ride. While ridersand drivers are able to call or text one another through the app, personal information, including real user phone numbers, are not revealed. Drivers are also not ableto see a rider\u2019s drop-off location, whether it\u2019s a specific address or a cross-street, after the ride is complete.\u2022Two-way ratings and mandatory feedback. At  the end of each trip, drivers and riders are prompted to rate their ride on the scale of one to five stars. Any rider ordriver  who submits  a rating  of four  stars or fewer  is prompted  to provide  more details.  Anyone who rates  a rider  or driver  three  stars  or fewer  will never  bematched with that individual again through the app.In 2021, we published our Community Safety Report, which is available on our website and details the frequency of some of the most serious safety incidents thatare reported to us, which are statistically very rare. From 2017 to 2019, over 99% of trips occurred without any reported safety incident, which accounted for 0.0002% of alltrips in this period. However, while safety incidents on our platform are incredibly rare, we recognize that behind every report is a real person and real experience, and ourgoal is to make each Lyft ride as safe as we possibly can.Government RegulationWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions.

As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  4,453  employees  inapproximately 119 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks. Approximately 40% of our employees work in our productmanagement, engineering, design and science organizations. Our employees are passionate about our mission to improve people\u2019s lives with the world\u2019s best transportation.We believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more ouremployees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2021, our employee base was 59%male and 39% female, and women represented 37% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 44% White, 30% Asian, 11% Hispanic or Latinx,8% Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity information is basedon  self-identification,  and  employees  who  did  not  disclose  their  gender  or  ethnicity  have  been  excluded  from  the  applicable  disclosure.  As  of  December  31,  2021,employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 2% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 2% oftotal U.S. employees.We strive to build a more representative workforce which requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, developtalent internally, and open up pathways for advancement. We launched initiatives such as requiring all director level and above roles to consider at least one woman andone  Black  or  Latinx  candidate  at  the  onsite  interview  stage.  We  are  continuing  to  focus  on  scaling  and  sustaining  diverse  partnerships  and  early  candidate  pipelinedevelopment as we believe recruiting and hiring initiatives can yield short and long-term benefits to the organization.One of the most powerful examples of Lyft\u2019s devotion to inclusivity is our ongoing commitment to pay fairness. We conducted an annual pay equity audit for ourfifth consecutive year to assess for any systemic issues in our compensation. We worked with third party experts to conduct statistical tests on a majority of U.S. based teammembers\u2019  annual  salary,  equity  awards,  and  total  compensation  at  hire.  The  goal  was  to  identify  whether  any  statistically  significant  pay  differences  existed  betweendifferent demographic (gender and race) groups in the same band, level and job family. Where our analysis identified differences, we investigated, including looking atfactors not accounted for in the statistical models we used. In 2021, we did not find patterns of statistically significant pay differences for different gender or racial groupsafter accounting for legitimate business factors like performance, experience, and location.Given continued uncertainty and as we recognize our remote work policy must be broadened, we have given many employees the option to work from home.None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.In December 2020, we released our 2020 Inclusion, Diversity and Racial Equity Report, which is available on our website. We have presented this report since2017 and intend to continue to present this report to make available certain information about our diversity and inclusion efforts.Environmental, Social and Corporate GovernanceIn May 2021, we released our 2021 Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance Report, which is available on our website.

This  is  in  line  with  the  Clean  Miles  Standard  and  Incentive  Program  which  was  approved  by  theCalifornia Air Resources Board in May 2021 and sets the target that ninety percent of rideshare miles in California must be in EVs by the end of 2030. The shift to 100%EVs will mean transitioning all vehicles used on the Lyft platform over the next decade to all-electric or other zero-emission technologies. This includes cars in ExpressDrive, Lyft Rentals, Lyft Autonomous, and personal cars used by drivers on the Lyft platform. Switching to EVs is not just good for the planet; it\u2019s good for people \u2013 riders,drivers, and the communities they serve.SocialWe approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust,respect and a common objective of improving people\u2019s lives by improving transportation. Through our LyftUp initiative, we\u2019re working to enable access to affordable,reliable transportation for all \u2014 no matter income or zip code. We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most seriousoutstanding transportation gaps. Through our LyftUp programs, we partner with leading organizations, including government agencies and nonprofits, to provide access tofree and discounted car, bike and scooter rides to individuals and families in need. LyftUp programs included:\u2022Jobs Access - provides rides to and from job interviews, job trainings and/or the first few weeks of a new job;\u2022Grocery Access - provides rides to and from the grocery store for families living in certain areas without sufficient grocery store access;\u2022Community Grants Program - awards ride credits to hyp erlocal nonprofit organizations across the country making a difference in their communities;\u2022Micromobility  Access -  provides  deeply  discounted  bikeshare  and  scooter-share  memberships  for  eligible  applicants  who  qualify  for  federal,  state  or  localassistance programs;\u2022Universal Vaccine Access Campaign -  mobilizes a coalition of partners to provide rides to and from COVID-19 vaccination sites for low-income, underinsuredand at-risk communities;\u2022Disaster Response - provides rides to access v ital services both leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies when roads are safe to do so;and\u2022Voting Access - provides rides to the polls during Federal elections, with a focus on supporting individuals who traditionally face barriers to voting, such asseniors, veterans and communities of color.In response to the passage of Texas Senate Bill 8 (\u201cSB8\u201d) which raised concerns that drivers could be sued simply for transporting passengers, Lyft created aDriver Legal Defense Fund to cover 100% of legal fees for drivers sued under SB8 while driving on our platform. We also donated $1 million to Planned Parenthood tohelp ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access. Drivers using Lyft are never responsible for monitoring where their riders go or why. Similarly, ridersshould never have to justify or share where they are going or why.Corporate GovernanceOur board of directors regularly evaluates our corporate governance structure and processes to help steer the company's direction and ensure it is operating withthe utmost business integrity.

expected to continue to disrupt and harm, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Weare unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related effects will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operationsand the achievement of our strategic objectives.Our business, operations and financial performance have been negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, suchas travel bans, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders. The pandemic and these related responses continue to evolve and have caused, and are expected to continue tocause,  decreased  demand  for  our  platform  relative  to  pre-COVID-19  demand,  disruptions  in  global  supply  chains,  and  significant  volatility  and  disruption  of  financialmarkets.The COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, thosediscussed below:\u2022Declines in travel as a result of COVID-19, including commuting, local travel, and business and leisure travel, have resulted in decreased demand for our platformwhich has decreased our revenues. These factors have in the past and may continue to lead to a decrease in earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Wepaused our shared rides offerings as a result of COVID-19, but relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021. While certain typesof  travel  have  begun  to  increase  compared  to  earlier  periods  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  overall  levels  remain  depressed  and  changes  in  travel  trends  andbehavior arising from COVID-19, including as a result of new strains of COVID-19, may continue to develop or persist over time and further contribute to thisadverse effect.\u2022Changes in driver behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic have led to reduced levels of driver availability on our platform relative to rider demand in certainmarkets. This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability is limited, our service levels have been and may be negativelyimpacted and we have increased prices or provided additional incentives and may need to continue to do so, which may adversely affect our business, financialcondition and results of operation.\u2022The responsive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to modify our business practices by permitting corporate employees in nearly all of ourlocations  to  work  remotely,  limiting  employee  travel,  and  canceling,  postponing  or  holding  virtual  events  and  meetings.  We  may  be  required  to  or  choosevoluntarily to take additional actions for the health and safety of our workforce and users of our platform, including after the pandemic subsides and with respectto vaccination, whether in response to government orders or based on our own determinations of what is in the best interests of our employees or users of ourplatform. The effects of the pandemic, including permanent hybrid and remote working arrangements for employees, may also impact our real estate footprint,financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and may increase the risk of a cybersecurity breach or incident. Tothe extent these measures result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture, adversely affect our ability to timely and accurately report our financialstatements or maintain internal controls, or otherwise negatively affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\u2022We design and contract to manufacture Light Vehicles using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of LightVehicles that meet our standards is critical to our operations. We also design and contract to manufacture certain assets related to our network of shared LightVehicles and we rely on a small number of suppliers for components and manufacturing services. We have faced challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemicrelated  to  these  assets,  such  as  delays  in  their  manufacture  and  delivery  and  increased  costs  associated  with  manufacturing  and  shipping,  and  we  may  faceadditional challenges  in future periods.

Further, COVID-19 has and may continue to negatively impact Lyft\u2019s ability to conduct rental operationsthrough the Express Drive program and Lyft Rentals as a result of restrictions on travel, mandated closures, limited staffing availability, and other factors relatedto COVID-19. For example, in 2020, Lyft Rentals temporarily ceased operations, closing its rental locations, as a result of COVID-19. Further, while ExpressDrive rental periods renew on a weekly basis, new rental reservations were temporarily blocked in 2020, and subsequently re-opened with modified operations tolimit the proximity and amount of interactions between associates and drivers, and to address additional cleaning which may be required as a result of COVID-19.These operations are more costly, and vulnerable to shortages of cleaning supplies or other materials required to operate rental sites while minimizing the risk ofexposure to COVID-19. As a result of the adverse impact to demand for rides on the rideshare platform, drivers renting through the Express Drive program havehad and may continue to have a diminished ability to pay their rental fees. In response, in 2020, Flexdrive temporarily reduced pricing for Flexdrive rentals incities most affected by COVID-19, which has since been reversed. In 2020, Flexdrive also began to waive rental fees for drivers who are confirmed to have testedpositive for COVID-19 or requested to quarantine by a medical professional, which it continues to do at this time.

Further, theultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our users, customers, employees, business, operations and financial performance depends on many factors that arenot within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to thepandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport and modified workplace activities); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response thereto onlocal  or  regional  economies,  travel  and  economic  activity;  the  speed  and  efficacy  of  vaccine  distribution;  the  availability  of  government  funding  programs;evolving laws and regulations regarding COVID-19, including those related to disclosure, notification and pricing; general economic uncertainty in key marketsand financial market volatility; volatility in our stock price, global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; the duration of the pandemic; the extent ofany virus mutations or new strains of COVID-19; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.\u2022In light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financialand operating results.Our business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, economic downturns or other unexpected events.A significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, hurricane, tornado, flood or significant power outage, could disrupt our operations, mobile networks, theInternet or the operations of our third-party technology providers. In particular, our corporate headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known forseismic activity and increasingly for fires. The impact of climate change may increase these risks. In addition, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,other epidemics, political  crises, such as terrorist  attacks, war and other political  or social instability and other geopolitical  developments, or other catastrophic  events,whether in the United States or abroad, could adversely affect our operations or the economy as a whole. For example, we have offices and employees in Belarus andUkraine that are expected to be adversely affected by the current conflict in the region. The impact of any natural disaster, act of terrorism or other disruption to us or ourthird-party providers\u2019 abilities could result in decreased demand for our offerings or a delay in the provision of our offerings, which could adversely affect our business,financial condition and results of operations. All of the aforementioned risks may be further increased if our disaster recovery plans prove to be inadequate.A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and results of operations are also subject to global economic conditions, including any resulting effect on spending by us or riders.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5092, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "76793e33-e862-46d1-ba36-aa0669fb359d": {"__data__": {"id_": "76793e33-e862-46d1-ba36-aa0669fb359d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "aa0299ac-4859-4471-bc9b-0f8f1e12370f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "633f598076a2000b97b325efbb7a875c9df880e46883e6ae4c773435754f51ac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e6bd4ec4-d8e2-4380-974b-10fe37f9fc41", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "18", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "b7a337323992dc4de752e27e1d2df9a4964dac602d6a3592f8f3050f8106b035", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For example, we have offices and employees in Belarus andUkraine that are expected to be adversely affected by the current conflict in the region.

In recent periods, we have also reevaluated and changed our cost structure and focused ourbusiness model. Our evolving business, industry and markets make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. Risks andchallenges we have faced or expect to face include our ability to:\u2022forecast our revenue and budget for and manage our expenses;\u2022attract new qualified drivers and new riders and retain existing qualified drivers and existing riders in a cost-effective manner;\u2022comply with existing and new or modified laws and regulations applicable to our business;\u2022manage our platform and our business assets and expenses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures issued by various jurisdictions,including  travel  bans,  travel  restrictions  and  shelter-in-place  orders,  as  well  as  maintain  demand  for  and  confidence  in  the  safety  of  our  platform  during  andfollowing the COVID-19 pandemic;\u2022plan for and manage capital expenditures for our current and future offerings, including our network of Light Vehicles or certain vehicles in the Express Driveprogram and the fleet of vehicles for Lyft Rentals, and manage our supply chain and supplier relationships related to our current and future offerings;\u2022develop, manufacture, source, deploy, maintain and ensure utilization of our assets, including our network of Light Vehicles, Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, MobileServices, Lyft Auto Care, certain vehicles in the Express Drive program, vehicles for Lyft Rentals and autonomous vehicle technology;\u2022anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\u2022maintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\u2022effectively manage our growth and business operations, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business;\u2022successfully expand our geographic reach;\u2022hire, integrate and retain talented people at all levels of our organization;\u2022successfully develop new platform features, offerings and services to enhance the experience of users; and\u2022right-size our real estate portfolio.If we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this\u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have an evolving financial model andoperate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a static financial model oroperated  in  a  more  predictable  market.  We  have  encountered  in  the  past,  and  will  encounter  in  the  future,  risks  and  uncertainties  frequently  experienced  by  growingcompanies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate ourbusiness, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business,financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Prior to COVID-19, we grew rapidly. In 2020, due to COVID-19 and the related government and public health measures, our revenue declined significantly andwe have since recovered partially, but our revenue remains below pre-COVID levels and the timeline for a full recovery is uncertain. Accordingly, our recent revenuegrowth rate and financial performance, including prior to the effects of COVID-19, the decline related to COVID-19 and recent growth rates compared to periods in themidst of the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, although we have achieved Adjusted EBITDA profitability ineach of the last three quarters, we have incurred net losses each year since our inception and we can provide no assurances that we will achieve or maintain AdjustedEBITDA profitability in the future, on a quarterly or annual basis, or that we will ever achieve profitability on a GAAP basis.19", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4762, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f6fccb0a-4bf5-45e2-a227-e8d28e371465": {"__data__": {"id_": "f6fccb0a-4bf5-45e2-a227-e8d28e371465", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "af60ff0b-e260-4946-901b-809113cd2387", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "9013e21e42e15344195a001f9ea7f60d2a51b38cc8c3ab04826a5ea37d5b5ac6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "0b0d3233-3fa2-4998-a991-9085b77805a3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d90380833f3c6d27646c375e5c5da9d446662e9503927377fa22c04dd0cc46ba", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Our expenses\n will likely increase in the future as we develop and launch new offerings and platform features, expand in existing and new markets and continue toinvest  in  our  platform  and  customer  engagement,  or  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  These  efforts  may  be  more  costly  than  we  expect  and  may  not  result  inincreased  revenue  or  growth  in  our  business.

These offerings and programs require significant capital investments and recurring costs, including debt payments, maintenance, depreciation,asset life and asset replacement costs, and if we are not able to maintain sufficient levels of utilization of such assets or such offerings are otherwise not successful, ourinvestments may not generate sufficient returns and our financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition to the above, a determination in, or settlement of, anylegal proceeding that classifies a driver on a ridesharing platform as an employee may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations (includingpotentially suspending or ceasing operations in impacted jurisdictions), increase our costs and impact our ability to add qualified drivers to our platform and grow ourbusiness, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.Additionally,  stock-based  compensation  expense  related  to  restricted  stock  units  (\u201cRSUs\u201d)  and  other  equity  awards  may  continue  to  be  a  significant  expense  in  futureperiods, and as of December 31, 2021, we had $587.5 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, that will berecognized  over  a  weighted-average  period  of  approximately  1.7  years.

Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections, or theexpectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to decline.The ridesharing market and the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, are still in relatively early stages of growth and development andif such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large or otherwise develop as we expect, our business, financial conditionand results of operations could be adversely affected.Prior to COVID-19, the ridesharing market grew rapidly, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow,particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, if at all. In addition, the market for our other offerings, such as our network of Light Vehicles, is new and unproven, and it isuncertain whether demand for bike and scooter sharing will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on thewillingness of people to widely adopt ridesharing and our other offerings. We cannot be certain whether the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact thewillingness of drivers or riders to participate in ridesharing or the willingness of riders to use shared bikes or scooters. In addition, we paused our shared rides offerings(though we relaunched our shared rides offerings in select markets beginning in July 2021), and we were temporarily restricted from operating our bike share and scootershare programs in one jurisdiction due to public health and safety measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequently temporarily suspendedrentals of scooters due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. Although the scooter rental suspension was lifted in February 2021, in the event of a resurgence ofCOVID-19, we may be required or believe it is advisable to suspend such offerings again.

Additionally, from time to time we may re-evaluatethe markets in which we operate and the performance of our network of Light Vehicles, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certainmarkets as a result of such evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers, or to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers, our business, financial condition andresults of operations could be harmed.Our continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain qualified drivers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and toincrease  utilization  of  our  platform  by  existing  drivers.  To  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers,  we  have,  among  other  things,  offered  sign-up  and  referral  bonuses  andprovided access to third-party vehicle rental programs for drivers who do not have or do not wish to use their own vehicle. If we do not continue to provide drivers withflexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to earn income and other incentive programs, such as volume-based discounts and performance-based bonuses, that arecomparable or superior to those of our competitors and other companies in the app-based work industry, or if drivers become dissatisfied with our programs and benefits orour requirements for drivers, including requirements regarding the vehicles they drive, we may fail to attract new drivers, retain current drivers or increase their utilizationof our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, strikes or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example,during the pandemic, we have periodically had a shortage of available drivers relative to rider demand in certain markets particularly where restrictions on social activitiesand visiting business venues were or have been eased. This imbalance fluctuates for various reasons, and to the extent that driver availability remains limited and we offerincreased incentives to improve supply, our revenue may be negatively impacted. Additionally, following the passage of Proposition 22 in California, drivers have beenable to access the earning opportunities described in the ballot measure. Our competitors may attempt to compete for drivers on the basis of these earning opportunities, ordrivers may determine that such earning opportunities are not sufficient. Further, other jurisdictions may adopt similar laws and regulations, which would likely increaseour  expenses.  Notwithstanding  the  passage  of  Proposition  22,  ongoing  litigation  seeking  to  reclassify  drivers  as  employees  is  pending  in  multiple  jurisdictions.  Thisincludes  a  lawsuit  seeking  to  overturn  Proposition  22  in  California,  where  a  lower-court  judge  issued  an  order  on  August  20,  2021  finding  that  Proposition  22  isunenforceable (which order is now on appeal with Proposition 22 remaining in effect during the appeal). If such litigation is successful in one or more jurisdictions, we maybe  required  to  classify  drivers  as  employees  rather  than  independent  contractors  in  those  jurisdictions.  If  this  occurs,  we  may  need  to  develop  and  implement  anemployment model that we have not historically used or to cease operations, whether temporarily or permanently, in affected jurisdictions. We may face specific risksrelating to our ability to onboard drivers as employees, our ability to partner with third-party organizations to source drivers and our ability to effectively utilize employeedrivers to meet rider demand.If  drivers  are  unsatisfied  with  our  partners,  including  our  third-party  vehicle  rental  partners,  our  ability  to  attract  and  retain  qualified  drivers  who  satisfy  ourscreening criteria and procedures and to increase utilization of our platform by existing drivers could be adversely affected. Further, incentives we provide to attract driverscould fail to attract and retain qualified drivers or fail to increase utilization by existing drivers, or could have other unintended adverse consequences.

For  example,  in  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  2020,  we  entered  into  a  Novation  Agreement  to  transfer  nearly  all  of  our  primary  auto  insuranceliabilities  related  to  periods  preceding  October  2018  to  a  third-party,  in  October  2020,  we  expanded  our  rideshare  insurance  program  to  include  additional  third-partyinsurance-service  providers,  and  in  April  2021,  we  executed  an  agreement  to  reinsure  our  captive  insurance  entity  for  $183  million  of  coverage  above  the  insuranceliabilities recorded as of March 31, 2021 for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020. We are subject to recapture of the risk if ourthird party reinsurer were to default on their reinsurance obligation.Any negative publicity related to any of our third-party insurance service providers could adversely affect our reputation and brand and could potentially lead toincreased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our reputation, brand and the network effects among the drivers and riders on our platform are important to our success, and if we are not able to maintain andcontinue developing our reputation, brand and network effects, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We believe that building a strong reputation and brand as a safe, reliable and affordable platform and continuing to increase the strength of the network effectsamong the drivers and riders on our platform are critical to our ability to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders.

Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader rangeof offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than we do. Thisincludes the use of pricing algorithms to set dynamic prices depending on the route, time of day and pick-up and drop-off locations of riders. From time to time, we havemade pricing changes and spent significant amounts on marketing and both rider and driver incentives, and we expect that, from time to time, we will be required, throughcompetition, regulation or otherwise, to reduce the price of rides for riders, increase the incentives we pay to drivers on our platform or reduce the fees we charge thedrivers on our platform, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain qualified drivers and riders in response to competitive pressures. Furthermore,the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to competeeffectively in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects. For example, state and local lawsand  regulations  regarding  pricing  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  otherwise  have  imposed  limits  on  prices  for  certain  services  and  certain  local  regulationsregarding minimum earnings standards for drivers have caused us to revise our pricing methodology in certain markets, including New York City and Seattle.

A determination in, or settlement of, any legal proceeding, whether we are party to such legal proceeding or not, that classifies a driver utilizing a ridesharingplatform  as  an  employee,  may  require  us  to  revise  our  pricing  methodologies  to  account  for  such  a  change  to  driver  classification.  The  passage  of  Proposition  22  inCalifornia has enabled us to provide additional earning opportunities to drivers in California, including guaranteed earnings. The transition has, and will continue to, requireadditional costs and we expect to face other challenges as we transition drivers to this new model, including changes to our pricing. We have also tested or launched, andmay in the future test or launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for drivers on our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retainingqualified  drivers.  Moreover,  successful  litigation  to  overturn  Proposition  22, or  the  reclassification  of  drivers  on  our platform  as employees  could  reduce  the  availablesupply of drivers as drivers leave the platform due to the changes in flexibility under an employment model. While we do and will attempt to optimize ride prices andbalance supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we couldbe underpricing or overpricing our offerings. In addition, if the offerings on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies.

For example, in 2021, in New York City, a competing operator named Joco attempted to launch a bike share program in violation of Citi Bike\u2019s exclusivity,arguing that New York City could not regulate Joco because Joco\u2019s stations were in private garages. The City successfully obtained a preliminary injunction against Joco,with our support. However, Joco continues to operate in a limited manner and it is possible Lyft may need to further support the City in additional legal action against Joco.A negative  determination  in other legal  disputes regarding  bike and scooter  sharing, including  an adverse  determination  regarding  our existing  rights to operate,  couldadversely affect our competitive position and results of operations. Additionally, we may from time to time be denied permits to operate, or be temporarily restricted fromoperating due to public health and safety measures, our bike share program or scooter share program in certain jurisdictions. For example, the City of Miami suspendedrentals  of  bikes  and  scooters  from  March  through  October  2020  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic  and  again  suspended  rentals  of  scooters  from  December  2020through February 2021 and for a brief period in November 2021 due to concerns with certain aspects of the program. While we do not expect any denial or suspension in anindividual region to have a material impact, these denials or suspensions in the aggregate could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Even if we are ableto successfully develop and implement our network of Light Vehicles, there may be heightened public skepticism of this nascent service offering. In particular, there couldbe negative public perception surrounding bike and scooter sharing, including the overall safety and the potential for injuries occurring as a result of accidents involving anincreased number of bikes and scooters on the road, and the general safety of the bikes and scooters themselves. Such negative public perception may result from incidentson our platform or incidents involving our competitors\u2019 offerings.We design and contract to manufacture bikes and scooters using a limited number of external suppliers, and a continuous, stable and cost-effective supply of bikesand scooters that meets our standards is critical to our operations. We expect to continue to rely on external suppliers in the future. There can be no assurance we will beable to maintain our existing relationships with these suppliers and continue to be able to source our bikes and scooters on a stable basis, at a reasonable price or at all. Wealso  design  and  contract  to  manufacture  certain  assets  related  to  our  network  of  Light  Vehicles  and  we  rely  on  a  small  number  of  suppliers  for  components  andmanufacturing services.The supply chain for our bikes and scooters exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or shortages. In the event that our supply of bikes andscooters or key components is interrupted or there are significant increases in prices, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Changes in business conditions, force majeure, any public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental or regulatory changes and other factors beyond ourcontrol have affected and could continue to affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to deliver products and our ability to deploy products to the market on a timely basis.We incur significant costs related to the design, purchase, sourcing and operations of our network of Light Vehicles and we expect to continue incurring such costsas we expand our network of Light Vehicles.

The number of our full-time employees increased from 2,708 as of December 31, 2017, to 4,453as of December 31, 2021. However, from time to time, we have undertaken restructuring actions to better align our financial model and our business. For example, in thesecond quarter of 2020, we implemented a plan of termination to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic challenges resultingfrom the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, which plan involved the termination of approximately 17% of our employees. Steps we take to manage ourbusiness operations, including remote work policies for employees, and to align our operations with our strategies for future growth may adversely affect our reputation andbrand, our ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel.Our ability to manage our growth and business operations effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business willrequire us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage employees. Continued growthcould strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train and retainhighly skilled personnel and maintain user satisfaction.

AWS\u2019 facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurityattacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform\u2019s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. Wehave experienced, and expect that in the future we will experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors,including  infrastructure  changes, human  or software  errors,  website  hosting  disruptions  and capacity  constraints.  In addition,  any changes  in AWS\u2019 service  levels  mayadversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users.

For example, in September 2019, GM issued a recall affecting the 2018 Chevy Malibu, which affected a moderate portion of the fleet provided by Lyft\u2019s rentalpartners. In addition, in May 2020, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection, which affected their ability to meet the requirements of our Express Drive program.

Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affectour business, financial condition and results of operations.Our Express Drive program, Lyft Rentals program, and potential future fleet businesses expose us to certain risks, including with respect to decreases in the residualvalue related to the used car market values, or reductions in the utilization of vehicles in the fleets.For  the  Lyft  Rentals  consumer  car  rental  business  and,  through  our  independently  managed  subsidiary,  Flexdrive,  for  vehicles  rented  to  drivers  through  ourExpress  Drive  program,  a  portion  of  the  fleet  is  sourced  from  a  range  of  auto  manufacturers.  In  addition,  we  have  established  environmental  programs,  such  as  ourcommitment to 100% EVs on our platform by the end of 2030, that may limit the range of auto manufacturers or vehicles that we source from or purchase. To the extentthat any of these auto manufacturers significantly curtail production, increase the cost of purchasing cars or decline to sell cars to us on terms or at prices consistent withpast agreements, despite sourcing vehicles from the used car market and other efforts to mitigate, we may be unable to obtain a sufficient number of vehicles to operate ourExpress Drive or Lyft Rentals businesses without significantly increasing fleet costs or reducing volumes. Similarly, where events, such as natural disasters or public healthcrises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, make operating rental locations difficult or impossible, or adversely impact rider demand, the demand for or our ability to rentvehicles in Lyft Rentals or the Express Drive program has been and could continue to be adversely affected, resulting in reduced utilization of the vehicles in the fleets.Reduced utilization has increased and could continue to increase costs of maintaining the fleets or storing or moving unused vehicles.The costs of the fleet vehicles may also be adversely impacted by the relative strength of the used car market. We currently sell vehicles through auctions, third-party resellers and other channels in the used vehicle marketplace. Such channels may not produce stable used vehicle prices. It may be difficult to estimate the residualvalue of vehicles used in ridesharing, such as those rented to drivers through our Express Drive program. Further, market events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, haveaffected the demand for or pricing in the used vehicle market. For example, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, operators of large fleets, such as rental companies, arereportedly  seeking  to  place  large  volumes  of  vehicles  into  the  resale  market,  which  have  driven  down  the  price  and  corresponding  residual  value  of  used  vehicles.  Areduction in residual values for vehicles in the Flexdrive or Lyft Rentals fleets could cause us to sustain a substantial loss on the ultimate sale of such vehicles or require usto depreciate those vehicles at a more accelerated rate. If we are unable to obtain and maintain the fleet of vehicles cost-efficiently or if we are unable to accurately forecastthe residual values of vehicles in the fleets, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We  rely  on  third-party  payment  processors  to  process  payments  made  by  riders  and  payments  made  to  drivers  on  our  platform,  and  if  we  cannot  manage  ourrelationships with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We rely on a limited number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by riders and payments made to drivers on our platform.

For example, we have experienced reduced revenue from actual and alleged unauthorized rides fulfilledand miles traveled in connection with our Concierge offering. If we are unable to adequately anticipate and address such misuse either through increased controls, platformsolutions or other means, our partner relationships, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we fail to effectively match riders on our Shared and Shared Saver Rides offering and manage the related pricing methodologies, our business, financial conditionand results of operations could be adversely affected.Shared and Shared Saver Rides enables unrelated parties traveling along similar routes to benefit from a discounted fare at the cost of possibly longer travel times.With  a  Shared  or  Shared  Saver  Ride,  when  the  first  rider  requests  a  ride,  our  algorithms  use  the  first  rider\u2019s  destination  and  attempt  to  match  them  with  other  riderstraveling along a similar route. If a match between riders is made, our algorithms re-route the driver to include the pick-up location of the matched rider on the active route.For Shared and Shared Saver Rides, drivers earn a fixed amount based on a number of factors, including the time and distance of the ride, the base fare charged to ridersand the level of rider demand. We determine the rider fare based on the predicted time and distance of the ride, the level of rider demand and the likelihood of being able tomatch additional riders along the given route, and such fare is quoted to the riders prior to their commitment to the ride. The fare charged to the riders is decoupled from thepayment made to the driver as we do not adjust the driver payment based on the success or failure of a match. Accordingly, if the discounted fare quoted and charged to ourShared or Shared Saver Rides riders is less than the fixed amount that drivers earn or if our algorithms are unable to consistently match Shared or Shared Saver Ridesriders, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If we fail to effectively manage our up-front pricing methodology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.With the adoption of our up-front pricing methodology, we quote a price to riders of our ridesharing offering before they request a ride. We earn platform andservice fees from drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider, which is generally based on an up-front quoted fare, and the amount earned by a driverbased on the actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider, in each case, less any applicable driver bonuses or incentives andany pass-through amounts paid to drivers and third parties. As we do not control the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip,we take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fully mitigated. We may incur a loss from a transaction where an up-front quoted fare paid by a rider isless  than  the  amount  we  committed  to  pay  a  driver.  In  addition,  riders\u2019  price  sensitivity  varies  by  geographic  location,  among  other  factors,  and  if  we  are  unable  toeffectively  account  for  such  variability  in  our  up-front  prices,  our  ability  to  compete  effectively  in  these  locations  could  be  adversely  affected.

For example, in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we took certain cost-cutting measures, including lay-offs,furloughs and salary reductions, which may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain employees.

If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, particularly incritical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals.We face intense competition for highly skilled personnel, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a substantial presence and need for highlyskilled personnel. This competition has intensified in recent periods, and may continue to intensify as the economy recovers from COVID-19. To attract and retain toptalent, we have had to offer, and we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and existing personnel oftenconsider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines or we are unable to providecompetitive compensation packages, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, and we may experience increased attrition.

Use  and  distribution  of  open  sourcesoftware may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification orother contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others tocompromise our platform and offerings.Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the type of opensource software we use, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could,under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public.

Alternatively,  to  avoid  the  public  release  of  theaffected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.Although we have processes for using open source software to avoid subjecting our platform and offerings to conditions we do not intend, the terms of many opensource licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipatedconditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform and offerings. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of opensource software against companies that incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership ofwhat we believe to be open source software. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our platform will beeffective.

These activities may not be successful, and any negative outcomes could adversely affect our business, operations, financial conditionand results of operations.Our industry is relatively nascent and is rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated. We have been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipalregulatory authorities across the United States and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ridesharing and bike and scooter sharing.For example, in December 2018, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission adopted rules governing minimum driver earnings calculations and utilization ratesapplicable to our ridesharing platform, as well as certain other ridesharing platforms. Our legal challenge was unsuccessful and other cities are exploring similar legislation.The  City  of  Seattle  adopted  the  Transportation  Network  Company  Driver  Minimum  Compensation  Ordinance  effective  January  1,  2021,  which  sets  minimum  driverearnings calculations for our rideshare platform as well as other rideshare platforms. The City of Portland is also exploring driver earnings legislation. Other jurisdictions inwhich we currently operate or may want to operate could follow suit. We could also face similar regulatory restrictions from foreign regulators as we expand operationsinternationally, particularly in areas where we face competition from local incumbents. Adverse changes in laws or regulations at all levels of government or bans on ormaterial limitations to our offerings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success, or perceived success, and increased visibility has driven, and may continue to drive, some businesses that perceive our business model negatively toraise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their trade association groups or other organizations have and may continue to take actionsand employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to changesuch legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of drivers and riders to utilize our platform.Any of the foregoing risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.Challenges to contractor classification of drivers that use our platform may have adverse business, financial, tax, legal and other consequences to our business.We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedingsat the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a driver is anindependent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and misclassification ofindependent  contractors  are  subject  to  changes  and  divergent  interpretations  by  various  authorities  which  can  create  uncertainty  and  unpredictability  for  us.

We  are  currently  involved  in  several  putative  class  actions,  severalrepresentative  actions  brought,  for  example,  pursuant  to  California\u2019s  Private  Attorney  General  Act,  several  multi-plaintiff  actions  and  thousands  of  individual  claims,including those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to our Terms of Service to arbitration, challenging the classification of drivers on our platform as independentcontractors.

In addition, certain companies and rights holders seek to enforce and monetize patents or other intellectual property rights they own, have purchased or otherwiseobtained.  As  we  gain  an  increasingly  high  public  profile  and  the  number  of  competitors  in  our  market  increases  and  as  we  continue  to  develop  new  technologies  andintellectual property, the possibility of intellectual property rights claims against us grows based on the following: increase in public profile, increases in the number ofcompetitors in our markets, our continued development of new technologies, new products and services, and new IP, as well as potential international expansion. From timeto time third parties may assert, and in the past have asserted, claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us. See the section titled \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d foradditional information about these types of legal proceedings. In addition, third parties have sent us correspondence regarding various allegations of intellectual propertyinfringement and, in some instances, have initiated licensing discussions. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses, there can be no assurance that we will besuccessful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business resolution that is satisfactory to us. Our competitors and others may now and in the future havesignificantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than us. In addition, we have faced, and may again in the future face, litigation involving patent holding companies orother adverse patent owners who have no relevant product or service revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence or protection.Many  potential  litigants,  including  some  of  our  competitors  and  patent-holding  companies,  have  the  ability  to  dedicate  substantial  resources  to  assert  their  intellectualproperty rights. Any claim of infringement by a third party, even those without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim, could distractour management from our business and could require us to cease use of such intellectual property. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required inconnection with intellectual property litigation, we risk compromising our confidential information during this type of litigation. We may be required to pay substantialdamages, royalties or other fees in connection with a claimant securing a judgment against us, we may be subject to an injunction or other restrictions that prevent us fromusing or distributing our intellectual property, or we may agree to a settlement that prevents us from distributing our offerings or a portion thereof, which could adverselyaffect our business, financial condition and results of operations.With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek out a license to continue operations found to be in violation of such rights, which maynot be available on favorable or commercially reasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses.

These laws, rules and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continuallychange, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, theCPRA will require new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information.The CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcementremain unclear. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies andincur additional compliance-related costs and expenses.

Contracted  healthcare  entities  including  healthcare  providers,  health  plans,  and  transportation  brokers  using  ourConcierge or Lyft Pass for Healthcare offerings are either covered entities or business associates under HIPAA. We must also comply with HIPAA as we use and disclosethe PHI of riders in our capacity as a business associate of other contracted healthcare entities. Compliance obligations under HIPAA include privacy, security and breachnotification obligations, and could subject us to increased liability for any unauthorized uses or disclosures of PHI determined to be a \u201cbreach.\u201d If we knowingly breach theHITECH Act\u2019s requirements, we could be exposed to criminal liability. A breach of our safeguards and processes could expose us to civil penalties that range from $100 -$50,000 per violation, with an annual maximum per violation calendar year cap of $1.5 million for \u201cwillful neglect\u201d violations and the possibility of civil litigation.Additionally, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data protection and information securitystandards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.

Any of these consequencescould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal obligationsto indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business, commercial, and government partners and current and former directors and officers.A  determination  in,  or  settlement  of,  any  legal  proceeding,  whether  we  are  party  to  such  legal  proceeding  or  not,  that  involves  our  industry,  could  harm  ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. For example, a determination that classifies a driver of a ridesharing platform as an employee, whether we are partyto such determination or not, could cause us to incur significant expenses or require substantial changes to our business model.In addition,  we regularly  include  arbitration  provisions  in  our Terms  of  Service  with the  drivers  and riders  on our platform.  These  provisions  are  intended  tostreamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However,arbitration may become more costly for us or the volume of arbitration may increase and become burdensome, and the use of arbitration provisions may subject us tocertain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation andbrand, we have in the past and may continue to limit our use of arbitration provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which couldincrease our litigation costs and exposure. For example, effective May 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by users and employees.Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federallaw, there is a risk that some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If ourarbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims are required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increasein our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which couldadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As we expand our platform offerings, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, and any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such lawsand  regulations  or  manage  the  increased  costs  associated  with  such  laws  and  regulations  could  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  ofoperations.As we continue to expand our platform offerings and user base, we may become subject to additional laws and regulations, which may differ or conflict from onejurisdiction to another. Many of these laws and regulations were adopted prior to the advent of our industry and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate oraddress the unique issues faced by our industry.For example, contracting with healthcare entities and transportation brokers representing healthcare entities may subject us to certain healthcare related laws andregulations. These laws and regulations may impose additional requirements on us and our platform in providing access to rides through the Lyft Platform on behalf ofhealthcare partners. Additional requirements may arise related to the collection and storage of data and systems infrastructure design, all of which could increase the costsassociated  with  our  offerings  to  healthcare  partners.  With  respect  to  our  healthcare  rides  matched  through  the  Lyft  Platform  and  provided  to  Medicaid  or  MedicareAdvantage beneficiaries, we are subject to healthcare fraud, waste and abuse laws that impose penalties for violations. Significant violations of such laws could lead to ourloss of Medicaid provider enrollment status, and could also potentially result in exclusion from the federal programs as an authorized transportation platform provider.Further, we may in certain circumstances be or become considered a government contractor with respect to certain of our services, which would expose us to certain riskssuch as the government\u2019s ability to unilaterally terminate contracts, the public sector\u2019s budgetary cycles and funding authorization, and the government\u2019s administrative andinvestigatory processes.Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to our platform offerings, it is possible that our practices, offerings orplatform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5179, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fea2614e-c6ee-46a1-bade-3a2dba9e12fb": {"__data__": {"id_": "fea2614e-c6ee-46a1-bade-3a2dba9e12fb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0f0b652b-e1e2-425b-92ec-12fb22fa94f9", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "6210de0befe098d935e4b0f57f03fa2008a4494ae1bfcb629ed12864e6435101", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f310c6f6-67e3-4c71-8631-3862caf59d39", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "45", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "81683624a35b63ee7f42d67b7611a787fc71bb927dbdc8f7cdf6f3ab828f3807", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Significant violations of such laws could lead to ourloss of Medicaid provider enrollment status, and could also potentially result in exclusion from the federal programs as an authorized transportation platform provider.Further, we may in certain circumstances be or become considered a government contractor with respect to certain of our services, which would expose us to certain riskssuch as the government\u2019s ability to unilaterally terminate contracts, the public sector\u2019s budgetary cycles and funding authorization, and the government\u2019s administrative andinvestigatory processes.Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other obligations relating to our platform offerings, it is possible that our practices, offerings orplatform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations or obligations.

We are continuing to refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information requiredto be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and formsand that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We arealso continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. We have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources in order tomaintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting.Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in the conditions in our business, including increasedcomplexity resulting from any international expansion, the expanded work-from-home practices of our employees in response to COVID-19 and permanent work-from-home  and  hybrid  work  arrangements,  new  offerings  on  our  platform  or  from  strategic  transactions,  including  acquisitions  and  divestitures.

Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of theInternet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates andare subject to adjustments.

New legislation may require us or drivers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax calculation, collection andremittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any suchdifference may adversely impact our results of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome isdetermined.Operating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, certain members of our managementteam have limited experience managing a public company.As a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to thereporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, therules  and  regulations  of  the  SEC  and  the  listing  standards  of  the  Nasdaq  Stock  Market.

Our Co-Founders together hold all of the issued andoutstanding  shares  of  our  Class  B  common  stock.  Accordingly,  Logan  Green,  our  co-founder,  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  a  member  of  our  board  of  directors  holdsapproximately 21.42% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock; and John Zimmer, our co-founder and President and Vice Chair of our board of directors, holdsapproximately 12.63% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, our Co-Founders, individually or together, will be able to significantly influencematters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale ofall or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transactions. Our Co-Founders, individually or together, may have interests that differ from yours and may votein a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a changein  control  of  our  company,  could  deprive  our  stockholders  of  an  opportunity  to  receive  a  premium  for  their  capital  stock  as  part  of  a  sale  of  our  company  and  mightultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock.

For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain oftheir indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones announced that they would cease to allow most newly public companies utilizing dual or multi-class capitalstructures to be included in their indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400 and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make upthe S&P Composite 1500. Beginning in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-class structuresand  temporarily  barred  new  multi-class  listings  from  certain  of  its  indices;  however,  in  October  2018,  MSCI  announced  its  decision  to  include  equity  securities  \u201cwithunequal voting structures\u201d in its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under the announced policies, our dualclass capital structure makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt topassively  track  those indices  will not be investing  in our stock. These policies  are still  fairly  new and it is as of yet unclear  what effect,  if any, they will have on thevaluations of publicly traded companies excluded from the indices, but it is possible that they may depress these valuations compared to those of other similar companiesthat are included. Because of our dual class structure, we will likely be excluded from certain of these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will nottake similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies  that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likelypreclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors.

For example, as disclosed above, beginning in April 2019, several putative class actions have been filed inCalifornia state and federal courts and derivative actions have been filed in Delaware and California federal courts against us, our directors, certain of our officers, andcertain  of  the  underwriters  named  in  our  IPO  Registration  Statement  alleging  violation  of  securities  laws,  breach  of  fiduciary  duties,  and  other  causes  of  action  inconnection with our IPO. Although we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them, such matters could result in substantialcosts and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.Sales  of  substantial  amounts  of  our  Class  A  common  stock,  or  the  perception  that  such  sales  have  or  could  occur,  could  depress  the  market  price  of  our  Class  Acommon stock.The market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market, and theperception  that  these  sales  have  or  could  occur  may  also  depress  the  market  price  of  our  Class  A  common  stock,  including  if  there  is  short-selling  or  other  hedgingtransactions.We have filed a registration statement to register shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction ofapplicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be available for immediateresale in the United States in the open market.Sales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. Thesesales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxycontest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change incontrol by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which theperson became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders.

Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expectedfor any period in the future.Financial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2021\u2022Total revenue was $3.2 billion, an increase of 36% year-over-year.\u2022Total costs and expenses were $4.3 billion, including stock-based compensation expense of $724.6 million and insurance costs related to changes to insurancereserves attributable to historical periods of $250.3 million.\u2022Loss from operations was $1.1 billion.\u2022Other income was $135.9 million, including a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million as a result of the gain on the transaction with Woven Planet.\u2022Net loss was $1.0 billion, a decrease of 42% and 61% compared to 2020 and 2019, respectively.\u2022Adjusted EBITDA was $92.9 million, marking the Company\u2019s first annual Adjusted EBITDA profit.\u2022Cash used in operating activities was $101.7 million.\u2022Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2021.Impact of COVID-19 to our BusinessThe  ongoing  COVID-19  pandemic  continues  to  impact  communities  in  the  United  States,  Canada  and  globally.  Since  the  pandemic  began  in  March  2020,governments  and  private  businesses  -  at  the  recommendation  of  public  health  officials  -  have  enacted  precautions  to  mitigate  the  spread  of  the  virus,  including  travelrestrictions  and  social  distancing  measures  in  many  regions  of  the  United  States  and  Canada,  and  many  enterprises  have  instituted  and  maintained  work  from  homeprograms and limited the number of employees on site. Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the pandemic and these related responses caused decreased demand for ourplatform leading to decreased revenues as well as decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Our business continues to be impacted by the COVID-19pandemic.Although we have seen some signs of demand improving as COVID-19 case counts trended down, particularly compared to the demand levels at the start of thepandemic, demand levels continue to be affected by the impact of variants and changes in case counts. The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain. Theextent  to  which  our  operations  will  continue  to  be  impacted  by  the  pandemic  will  depend  largely  on  future  developments,  which  are  highly  uncertain  and  cannot  beaccurately predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning COVID-19 variants and the severity of the pandemic and actions by government authoritiesand private businesses to contain the pandemic or recover from its impact, among other things. For example, an increase in cases due to variants of the virus has causedmany businesses to delay employees returning to the office. Even as travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders are modified or lifted, we anticipate that continued socialdistancing, altered consumer behavior, reduced travel and commuting, and expected corporate cost cutting will be significant challenges for us.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4316, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "171e9f57-6622-4d5f-95a0-234c9d629a3c": {"__data__": {"id_": "171e9f57-6622-4d5f-95a0-234c9d629a3c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "72944769-3026-4d15-b9ce-247d67be38d1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "6a5cff847fb0fdabd63f8e27d4bbe2c98799b9627cbb0d10d8946d3d285d4a55", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e9a85d41-9e9a-4f0b-9e1f-3ee27a6635b6", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "56", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "576d9ea6f9ac53849f7d5ba58a8448c75eb7ba376f196ceada98a2dc14181f6b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The exact timing and pace of the recovery remain uncertain.

In 2021, we saw continuedrecovery as vaccines were more widely distributed and more communities fully reopened, which resulted in revenue increasing 36% in 2021 compared to the prior year,and the number of Active Riders increasing 49.2% in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Net loss decreased $743.5 million, or 42%, from$1.8 billion in 2020 to $1.0 billion in 2021, which included a benefit from a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million from the transaction with Woven Planet. Adjusted EBITDA in2021  was  $92.9  million,  marking  our  first  annual  Adjusted  EBITDA  profitability.  We  remain  focused  on  our  long-term  growth  opportunities.  With  $2.3  billion  inunrestricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2021, we believe we have sufficient liquidity to continue business operations and totake action we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, stockholders, stakeholders and of drivers and riders on the Lyft Platform.

(\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)On July 13, 2021, we completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assetsrelated  to  our  self-driving  vehicle  division,  Level  5,  as  well  as  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyft  rideshare  and  fleet  data  to  accelerate  the  safety  andcommercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. We will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with thistransaction, with $165 million paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The divestiture  did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on our operations and financial  results, and therefore does not qualify for reporting as adiscontinued operation. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $119.3 million as a result of our transaction with Woven Planet, which was included in other income, net on theconsolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2021. Refer to Note 4 \"Divestitures\" to the consolidated financial  statements for informationregarding the divestiture of certain assets related to our self-driving vehicles division, Level 5.Reinsurance of Certain Legacy Auto Liability InsuranceOn April 22, 2021, our wholly-owned subsidiary,  Pacific  Valley Insurance  Company, Inc. (\u201cPVIC\u201d), entered  into a Quota Share Reinsurance  Agreement  (the\u201cReinsurance Agreement\u201d) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (\u201cDARAG\u201d), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, based on reserves inplace as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement, PVIC ceded toDARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, with anaggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (\u201cthe Reinsurance Transaction\u201d). The Reinsurance Agreement arrangement does not discharge PVIC ofits obligations to the policyholder. A loss of approximately $20.4 million for the net cost of the Reinsurance Transaction was recognized on the consolidated statement ofoperations for the nine months ended September 30, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.Active Riders and Revenue per Active RiderThe  COVID-19  pandemic  caused  a  significant  decrease  in  Active  Riders  and  in  revenue  per  Active  Rider  beginning  March  2020.

An Active Rider is identified bya unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter,that person would count as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a singleActive Rider. If a ride has been requested by an organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Ridersunless the ride is accessible in the Lyft App. Revenue per Active Rider is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by Active Riders for the same period.Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2020, some riders were able to access their Concierge rides in the Lyft App if they already had a Lyft account. Accordingly,Lyft updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider\u2019s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing the rider to accesstheir ride in the Lyft App. This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2020, allConcierge riders were excluded from the calculation of Active Riders as Concierge rides could not be matched with verified rider accounts.With the exception of the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, Active Riders in each of the three monthperiods  ended  June  30,  September  30,  and  December  31,  2021  increased  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020  as  vaccines  were  more  widely  distributed  and  morecommunities fully reopened. Active Riders in the three months periods ended June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2020 represented significantly lower Active Ridercounts since shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions were first implemented across North America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Theslight decrease in the number of Active Riders in the three months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was due primarilyto the increasing COVID-19 case counts from COVID-19 variants and their impact on demand as well as the seasonality we typically experience in the winter months.Revenue per Active Rider increased in each of the three months periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2021 as compared to the sameperiods  in  2020,  primarily  reflecting  the  improvement  in  demand  on  our  platform  compared  to  earlier  periods  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  had  materiallylimited people's mobility and severely reduced Active Riders. Revenue per Active Rider reached an all-time high in the three months ended December 31, 2021, increasingcompared to the three months ended September 30, 2021. This was driven by an increase in ride frequency as well as a shift toward higher revenue rides such as airportrides, reflecting the increased travel experienced in the fourth quarter in 2021 nationwide.

We recognize revenue from fees paid by drivers foruse of our Lyft Platform offerings in accordance with ASC 606 as described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

This service includes on-demand lead generation that assists drivers tofind, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from riders seeking transportation services and related collection activities using our Lyft Platform. As a result, our singleperformance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of a successful transportation service for riders.We evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we act as a principal by controlling the transportation service provided to therider or whether we act as an agent by arranging for third parties to provide the service to the rider. We facilitate the provision of a transportation service by a driver to arider (the driver\u2019s customer) in order for the driver to fulfill their contractual promise to the rider. The driver fulfills their promise to provide a transportation service to theircustomer  through  use  of  the  Lyft  Platform.  While  we  facilitate  setting  the  price  for  transportation  services,  the  drivers  and  riders  have  the  discretion  in  accepting  thetransaction price through the platform. We do not control the transportation services being provided to the rider nor do we have inventory risk related to the transportationservices. As a result, we act as an agent in facilitating the ability for a driver to provide a transportation service to a rider.We report revenue on a net basis, reflecting the service fees and commissions owed to us from the drivers as revenue, and not the gross amount collected from therider. We made this determination of not being primarily responsible for the services since we do not promise the transportation services, do not contract with drivers toprovide transportation services on our behalf, do not control whether the driver accepts or declines the transportation request via the Lyft Platform, and do not control theprovision of transportation services by drivers to riders at any point in time either before, during, or after, the trip.We  consider  the  ToS and our customary  business  practices  in identifying  the contracts  under  ASC 606. As our customary  business  practice,  a contract  existsbetween the driver and us when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the trip lapses, which typically is upon pickup of the rider. We collect the fare and related charges from riderson behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism and retain any fees owed to us before making the remaining disbursement todrivers; thus the driver\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.We earn service fees and commissions from the drivers either as the difference between an amount paid by a rider based on an upfront quoted fare and the amountearned by a driver based on actual time and distance for the trip or as a fixed percentage of the fare charged to the rider. In an upfront quoted fare arrangement, as we do notcontrol the driver\u2019s actions at any point in the transaction to limit the time and distance for the trip, we take on risks related to the driver\u2019s actions which may not be fullymitigated. We earn a variable amount from the drivers and may record a loss from a transaction, which is recorded as a reduction to revenue, in instances where an up-frontquoted fare offered to a rider is less than the amount we are committed to pay the driver.We  recognize  revenue  upon  completion  of  a  ride  as  the  single  performance  obligation  is  satisfied  and  we  have  the  right  to  receive  payment  for  the  servicesrendered upon the completion of the ride.We offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if wecannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.In some cases, we also earn Concierge platform fees from organizations that use our Concierge offering, which is a product that allows organizations to requestrides for their customers and employees through our ridesharing marketplace. Concierge platform fees are earned as a fixed dollar amount per ride or a percentage of theride price depending on the contract and such Concierge platform fee revenue is recognized on a gross basis.We recognize revenue from subscription fees paid by users to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable subscription period.We generate revenue from licensing and data access agreements. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling our promise to provide rideshare data and access toFlexdrive vehicles and bear the fulfillment risk, and the responsibility of providing the data, over the license period.

Revenue generated from Flexdriveand Lyft Rentals is recognized evenly over the rental period, which is typically seven days or less. Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and LightVehicle transactions, we classify these rentals as operating leases.Insurance ReservesWe utilize both a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary and third-party insurance, which may include deductibles and self-insured retentions, to insure orreinsure costs including auto liability, uninsured and underinsured motorist, auto physical damage, first party injury coverages including personal injury protection understate law and general business liabilities up to certain limits. The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have beenincurred but not yet reported and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these outstanding claim payments. Liabilities are determined ona quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application ofloss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness withclaims reserve valuations.Insurance claims may take years to completely settle, and we have limited historical loss experience. Because of the limited operational history, we make certainassumptions  based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significant  assumptions,  and  utilizeactuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open,economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in a prior year at a ratethat differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material. However, while webelieve that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As a result, the net amounts that willultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for in the consolidated balance sheets.We continue to review our insurance reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical experience develops, additional claims are reported as settled, and thelegal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.Stock-Based CompensationWe incur stock-based compensation expense primarily from RSUs, performance based stock units (\u201cPSUs\u201d), stock options and stock purchase rights granted underour Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201cESPP\u201d).We  estimate  the fair  value  of stock options  granted  to employees,  directors  and consultants  and ESPP purchase  rights  using the  Black-Scholes  option-pricingmodel.  The  fair  value  of  stock  options  that  are  expected  to  vest  is  recognized  as  compensation  expense  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period.  Werecognize compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The  fair  value  of  RSUs  and  PSUs  are  estimated  based  on  the  fair  market  value  of  our  common  stock  on  the  date  of  grant,  which  subsequent  to  our  IPO  isdetermined based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to our IPO, we granted RSUs which vest upon the satisfaction ofboth a service condition and a performance condition.Compensation  expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  theperformance  condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.

The excess of the fair value ofpurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.

Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from two to twelve years.Goodwill is not subject to amortization, but is tested for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. As part of the annual goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determinewhether further impairment testing is necessary. If, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than itscarrying amounts, the quantitative impairment test will be required.

We  have  adoptedmultiple measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot be certain that these actions will mitigate some or all of the negative effects of the pandemic on ourbusiness. In light of the evolving and unpredictable effects of COVID-19, we are not currently in a position to forecast the expected impact of COVID-19 on our financialand operating results in future periods.Revenue RecognitionRevenue consists of revenue recognized from fees paid by drivers for use of our Lyft Platform offerings, Concierge platform fees from organizations that use ourConcierge offering, subscription fees paid by riders to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform, revenue from our vehicle service centers and revenue fromlicensing and data access agreements. Revenue derived from these offerings are recognized in accordance with ASC 606 as described in the Critical Accounting Policiesand Estimates above and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.Revenue also consists of rental revenues recognized through leases or subleases primarily from Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and our network of Light Vehicles, whichincludes revenue generated from single-use ride fees paid by riders of Light Vehicles. Revenue derived from these offerings are recognized in accordance with ASC 842 asdescribed in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates above and in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.We offer various incentive programs to drivers that are recorded as reduction to revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service in consideration or if wecannot reasonably estimate the fair value of goods or services received.Cost of RevenueCost of revenue consists of costs directly related to revenue generating transactions through our multimodal platform which primarily includes insurance costs,payment processing charges, and other costs. Insurance costs consist of insurance generally required under TNC and city regulations for ridesharing and bike and scooterrentals and also includes occupational hazard insurance for drivers in California.

For more information regarding our use of these measuresand a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, see \u201cReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201dContribution and Contribution MarginContribution  and  Contribution  Margin  are  measures  used  by  our  management  to  understand  and  evaluate  our  operating  performance  and  trends.  We  believeContribution and Contribution Margin are key measures of our ability to achieve profitability and increase it over time. Contribution Margin has generally increased overthe periods presented as revenue has increased at a faster rate than the costs included in the calculation of Contribution.We define Contribution as revenue less cost of revenue, adjusted to exclude the following items from cost of revenue:\u2022amortization of intangible assets;\u2022stock-based compensation expense;\u2022payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation;\u2022changes to the liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historical periods;\u2022transaction costs related to certain legacy auto insurance liabilities, if any; and\u2022restructuring charges, if any.For more information about cost of revenue, see the section titled \u201cComponents of Results of Operations\u2014Cost of Revenue.\u201dContribution Margin is calculated by dividing Contribution for a period by revenue for the same period.We  record  changes  to  historical  liabilities  for  insurance  required  by  regulatory  agencies  for  financial  reporting  purposes  in  the  quarter  of  positive  or  adversedevelopment even though such development may be related to claims that occurred in prior periods. For example, if in the first quarter of a given year, the cost of claimsgrew by $1 million for claims related to the prior fiscal year or earlier, the expense would be recorded for GAAP purposes within the first quarter instead of in the results ofthe prior period. We believe these prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate the current period performance of our ongoing operations since these priorperiod changes relate to claims that could potentially date back years. We have limited ability to influence the ultimate development of historical claims. Accordingly,including the prior period changes would not illustrate the performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is run or managed by us. For consistency, we do notadjust the calculation of Contribution for any prior period based on any positive or adverse development that occurs subsequent to the quarter end. Annual Contribution iscalculated by adding Contribution of the last four quarters. We believe the adjustment to exclude changes to the historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatoryagencies  from  Contribution  and  Adjusted  EBITDA  is  useful  to  investors  by  enabling  them  to  better  assess  our  operating  performance  in  the  context  of  current  periodresults.During the second quarter of 2021, we entered into a Quota Share Reinsurance Agreement for the reinsurance of legacy auto insurance liabilities between October1, 2018 to October 1, 2020, based on the reserves in place as of March 31, 2021.

When the amount and timing of the reinsurance recoveries are uncertain, the recovery method should be used. The deferred gainliability would be amortized and recognized as a benefit to the statement of operations over the estimated remaining settlement period of the ceded reserves. The settlementperiod of the ceded reserves will be based on the life-to-date  cumulative  losses collected  and will likely extend over periods longer than a quarter.  The amount of thedeferral  will  be  recalculated  each  period  based  on  loss  payments  and  updated  estimates.  Consequently,  cumulative  adverse  development  for  claims  ceded  under  theReinsurance Agreement in subsequent periods may result in significant losses to the statement of operations unless the deferred gain amortization recognized in the sameperiod to offset said losses. We believe that the net amount recognized on the statement of operations associated with claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement,including any related adverse development and any benefit recognized for the related deferred gains, should be excluded to show the ultimate economic benefit of theReinsurance Agreement. This adjustment will help investors understand the economic benefit of our Reinsurance Agreement on future trends in our operations, as theyimprove  over  the  settlement  period  of  any  deferred  gains.  Additionally,  net  amounts  recognized  for  claims  ceded  under  the  Reinsurance  Agreement  would  representchanges to historical liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies. As stated above, we believe prior period changes to insurance liabilities do not illustrate thecurrent period performance of our ongoing operations or how the business is managed. This is because we have limited ability to influence the ultimate development ofthese historical claims, which can potentially date back years. Therefore, in the event that the net amount of any adverse developments and any benefits from deferred gainsrelated to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement is recognized on the statement of operations in a subsequent period, those amounts will be excluded from thecalculation of Contribution and Adjusted EBITDA through the exclusion of changes to liabilities for insurance required by regulatory agencies attributable to historicalperiods. As of December 31, 2021, there have been no such net amounts related to claims ceded under the Reinsurance Agreement which have impacted our consolidatedstatement of operations.We  had  restructuring  efforts  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  2020  to  reduce  operating  expenses  and  adjust  cash  flows  in  light  of  the  ongoing  economicchallenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business.

We have adopted several measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic including, but not limited to, establishing new health and safety requirements forridesharing, and updating workplace policies.

Those  standards  require  that  we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonableassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control overfinancial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our  audits  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  performing  procedures  to  assess  the  risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financialstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regardingthe amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made bymanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

A company\u2019s internal control over financial reportingincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositionsof the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance withgenerally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management anddirectors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019sassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with thepolicies or procedures may deteriorate.75", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3324, "end_char_idx": 5572, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e023d350-f885-422b-accd-2958ece37b22": {"__data__": {"id_": "e023d350-f885-422b-accd-2958ece37b22", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc81956c-9693-4a88-9480-fa0814f696e1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "80b81f01c9e4ee4f53b32053614e964dab52f2b7adb295e44419b83e66615188", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "8d68da24-2ca5-49a1-b40b-d81f4f8a343f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3a4f7b010d6a5ffd09503fcae63f7944e9dd3a32a32f10dddbc15a00a6cc6614", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Critical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor  required  to  be  communicated  to  the  audit  committee  and  that  (i)  relate  to  accounts  or  disclosures  that  are  material  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  and  (ii)involved  our  especially  challenging,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments.

As of December 31, 2021, insurancereserves totaled $1,069 million. Management makes certain assumptions based on currently available information and industry statistics, with the loss development factorsas one of the most significant assumptions and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. Liabilities are determined on a quarterly basis through ananalysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information and application of loss development factors among other inputs andassumptions.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves is a critical audit matter are (i) thesignificant judgment by management when developing the estimated insurance reserves, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort inperforming procedures relating to the valuation of insurance reserves; (ii) the significant auditor effort and judgment in evaluating audit evidence related to the actuarialvaluation methods and the loss development factors; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of insurance reserves, including the controls over the development ofthe actuarial valuation methods and the loss development factors. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill andknowledge  to  assist  in  developing  an  independent  estimate  of  the  insurance  reserves  for  certain  reserve  segments  and  comparison  of  this  independent  estimate  tomanagement\u2019s  actuarially  determined  reserves.  Developing  the  independent  estimate  involved  testing  the  completeness  and  accuracy  of  historical  data  provided  bymanagement, and independently developing loss development factors.Valuation of Certain Elements of the Transaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of ToyotaMotor Corporation, for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Company\u2019s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilizationof Lyft rideshare and fleet data. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash in connection with this transaction, with $165 million paid upfrontand  $350  million  to  be  paid  over  a  five-year  period.  As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  management  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangementconsideration  was  attributable  to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  theutilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certainassets  related  to  the  Level  5  division,  which  was  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  Level  5  division  assets,  valued  under  the  replacement  cost  method,  and  the  estimatedstandalone selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued using an adjusted market approach.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4851, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8d68da24-2ca5-49a1-b40b-d81f4f8a343f": {"__data__": {"id_": "8d68da24-2ca5-49a1-b40b-d81f4f8a343f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fc81956c-9693-4a88-9480-fa0814f696e1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "80b81f01c9e4ee4f53b32053614e964dab52f2b7adb295e44419b83e66615188", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "e023d350-f885-422b-accd-2958ece37b22", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "76", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "ba91c15f7907df724498bee772f36e315fd3dd1936eda5180bc3c60ee44c2376", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certainassets  related  to  the  Level  5  division,  which  was  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  Level  5  division  assets,  valued  under  the  replacement  cost  method,  and  the  estimatedstandalone selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued using an adjusted market approach.

Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesUse of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts ofassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expensesduring the reporting periods. The Company bases its estimates on various factors and information which may include, but are not limited to, history and prior experience,expected future results, new related events and economic conditions, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that arenot readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.85", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3300, "end_char_idx": 5597, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7538efa8-3c25-4bf9-9c74-dc7aa4bea6c7": {"__data__": {"id_": "7538efa8-3c25-4bf9-9c74-dc7aa4bea6c7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a6e501c0-1daa-421f-9389-1759ee51f5d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "86", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "8674c99053e56d16c87f7fd6b6ba85220e9b6567b5699dcc89e538c575cbe3dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Significant items\n subject to estimates and assumptions include those related to losses resulting from insurance claims, fair value of financial instruments, goodwilland  identifiable  intangible  assets,  leases,  indirect  tax  obligations,  legal  contingencies,  valuation  allowance  for  deferred  income  taxes,  and  the  valuation  of  stock-basedcompensation.Beginning in the middle of March 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) in the United States, Canada, and globally has impacted the Company\u2019sbusiness.

The  Company  recognizes  revenue  upon  completion  of  each  ride.  Drivers  enter  into  terms  of  service  (\u201cToS\u201d)  with  theCompany in order to use the Lyft Driver App. Under the ToS, drivers agree that the Company retains the applicable fee as consideration for their use of the Lyft Platformand related activities from the fare and related charges it collects from riders on behalf of drivers. The Company is acting as an agent in facilitating the ability of a driver toprovide a transportation service to a rider. The Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting the fee owed to the Company from a driver as revenue, and not the grossamount collected from the rider.As the Company\u2019s customary business practice, a contract exists between the driver and the Company when the driver\u2019s ability to cancel the ride lapses, whichtypically is upon pickup of the rider. The Company\u2019s single performance obligation in the transaction is to connect drivers with riders to facilitate the completion of asuccessful transportation service for riders. The Company recognizes revenue upon completion of a ride as its performance obligation is satisfied upon the completion ofthe ride. The Company collects the fare and related charges from riders on behalf of drivers using the rider\u2019s pre-authorized credit card or other payment mechanism andretains its fees before making the remaining disbursement to drivers; thus the driver\u2019s ability and intent to pay is not subject to significant judgment.The Company recognizes revenue from subscription fees paid to access transportation options through the Lyft Platform and mobile-based applications over theapplicable subscription period in accordance with ASC 606. The Company also recognizes revenue from auto maintenance and collision repair services in accordance withASC 606.The Company generates revenue from licensing and data access agreements. The Company is primarily responsible for fulfilling its promise to provide ridesharedata  and  access  to  Flexdrive  vehicles  and  bears  the  fulfillment  risk,  and  the  responsibility  of  providing  the  data,  over  the  license  period.  The  Company  is  acting  as  aprincipal in delivering the data and access licenses and presents revenue on a gross basis. Consideration allocated to each performance obligation, the data delivery andvehicle access, is determined by assigning the relative fair value to each of the performance obligations. Revenue is recorded upon delivery of the rideshare data and ratablyover the quarter for access to fleet vehicles as the Company\u2019s respective performance obligation is satisfied upon the delivery of each.Rental Revenue (ASC 842)The Company generates rental revenues primarily from Flexdrive, its network of Light Vehicles, and Lyft Rentals. Rental revenues are recognized for rental andrental related activities where an identified asset is transferred to the customer and the customer has the ability to control that asset in accordance with ASC 842.The Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive comprised of both owned vehicles and vehicles leased from third-party leasing companies. TheCompany either leases or subleases vehicles to drivers and Lyft Rentals renters, and as a result, the Company considers itself to be the accounting lessor or sublessor, asapplicable, in these arrangements in accordance with ASC 842. Fleet operating costs include monthly fixed lease payments and other vehicle operating or ownership costs,as applicable. For vehicles that are subleased, sublease income and head lease expense for these transactions are recognized on a gross basis on the consolidated financialstatements. Drivers who rent vehicles are charged rental fees, which the Company collects from the driver by deducting such amounts from the driver\u2019s earnings on the LyftPlatform.Due to the short-term nature of the Flexdrive, Lyft Rentals, and Light Vehicle transactions, the Company classifies these rentals as operating leases.

The allowance for credit losses reflects the Company\u2019s current estimate of expected credit losses inherent in the enterprise andtrade  receivables  balance.  In  determining  the  expected  credit  losses,  the  Company  considers  its  historical  loss  experience,  the  aging  of  its  receivable  balance,  currenteconomic and business conditions, and anticipated future economic events that may impact collectability. The Company reviews its allowance for credit losses periodicallyand as needed, and amounts are written off when determined to be uncollectible.The Company\u2019s receivable balance, which consists primarily of amounts due from Enterprise Users, was $196.2 million, $104.7 million and $120.0 million as ofDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company's allowance for credit losses was $9.3 million, $15.2 million and $6.2 million as of December 31, 2021,2020 and 2019,  respectively.  The write-offs  were  immaterial  for  the  year  ended  December  31, 2021. The  change  in the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  the  year  endedDecember 31, 2021 was related to $4.5 million of reductions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.4 million of write-offs. The change in the allowance for creditlosses for the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to $11.7 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $2.7 million of write-offs. The change inthe allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was related to $5.1 million of additions for provision for expected credit losses and $1.5 million ofwrite-offs.Incentive ProgramsThe Company offers incentives to attract drivers, riders, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters to use the Lyft Platform. Drivers generally receive cashincentives  while  riders,  Light  Vehicle  riders  and  Lyft  Rentals  renters  generally  receive  free  or  discounted  rides  under  such  incentive  programs.  Incentives  provided  todrivers, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rental renters, the customers of the Company, are accounted for as a reduction of the transaction price. As the riders are not theCompany\u2019s customers, incentives provided to riders are generally recognized as sales and marketing expense except for certain pricing programs described below.Driver IncentivesThe  Company  offers  various  incentive  programs  to  drivers,  including  minimum  guaranteed  payments,  volume-based  discounts  and  performance-based  bonuspayments.  These  driver  incentives  are  similar  to  retrospective  volume-based  rebates  and  represent  variable  consideration  that  is  typically  settled  within  a  week.  TheCompany reduces the transaction price by the estimated amount of the incentives expected to be paid upon completion of the performance criteria by applying the mostlikely outcome method. Therefore, such driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue. Driver incentives are recorded as a reduction to revenue if the Companydoes not receive a distinct good or service in exchange for the payment or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service received. Driver incentives forreferring new drivers or riders are accounted for as sales and marketing expense. The amount recorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the payment or theestablished fair value of the benefit received. The fair value of the benefit is established using amounts paid to third parties for similar services.Rideshare Rider IncentivesThe Company has several rideshare rider incentive programs, which are offered to encourage rider activity on the Lyft Platform. Generally, the rider incentiveprograms are as follows:(i)Market-wide marketing promotions. Market-wide  promotions reduce the fare charged by drivers to riders for all or substantially all rides in a specific market.This type of incentive effectively reduces the overall pricing of the service provided by drivers for that specific market and the gross fare charged by thedriver to the rider, and thereby results in a lower fee earned by the Company. Accordingly, the Company records this type of incentive as a reduction torevenue at the date it records the corresponding revenue transaction.(ii)Targeted marketing promotions. Targeted  marketing promotions are used to promote the use of the Lyft Platform to a targeted group of riders.

An example isa promotion where the Company offers a number of discounted rides (capped at a given number of rides) which are valid only during a limited period of timeto a targeted group of riders. The Company believes that the incentives that provide consideration to riders to be applied to a limited number of rides aresimilar  to  marketing  coupons.  These  incentives  differ  from  the  market-wide  marketing  promotions  because  they  do  not  reduce  the  overall  pricing  of  theservice  provided  by  drivers  for  a  specific  market.  During  the  promotion  period,  riders  not  utilizing  an  incentive  would  be  charged  the  full  fare.  Theseincentives represent marketing costs. When a rider redeems the incentive, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the transaction price and the cost of theincentive is recorded as sales and marketing expense.(iii)Rider referral programs. Under  the rider referral program, the referring rider (the referrer) earns referral coupons when a new rider (the referee) completestheir first ride on the Lyft Platform. The Company records the incentive as a liability at the time the incentive is earned by the referrer with the correspondingcharge  recorded  to  sales  and  marketing  expense.  Referral  coupons typically  expire  within  one  year.  The  Company  estimates  breakage  using its  historicalexperience. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the rider referral coupon liability was not material.88", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3666, "end_char_idx": 5873, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "037a9522-e58b-4af3-8af9-f01866b85ae6": {"__data__": {"id_": "037a9522-e58b-4af3-8af9-f01866b85ae6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5f47557e-5bac-4494-bfa6-5707bf2b63d3", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "89", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "8a0db2db1a3a70d16dedcced3350ea78a11f6b5ad97bf2346b5ea69e481506f3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Light Vehicle Rider and Lyft Renta\nls Renter IncentivesIncentives offered to Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, in relation to the driver, rider, Light Vehicle riders and Lyft Rentals renters incentive programs, theCompany recorded $1.3 billion, $390.8 million and $560.3 million as a reduction to revenue and $64.7 million, $135.0 million and $381.5 million as sales and marketingexpense, respectively.RefundsFrom  time  to  time  the  Company  issues  credits  or  refunds  to  riders  unsatisfied  by  the  level  of  service  provided  by  the  driver.

The expected term of the ESPPpurchase rights is estimated using the period from the beginning of the offering period to the end of each purchase period. Since the Company has limited history as apublic company and does not yet have sufficient trading history for the Company's common stock, the Company estimates volatility for stock options and ESPP purchaserights using the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly traded peer companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasuryzero-coupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the stock options or ESPP purchase rights granted.The fair value of stock options that are expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line  basis over the requisite service period. TheCompany recognizes compensation expense related to the ESPP purchase rights on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is typically 12 months.The fair value of RSUs and PSUs is estimated based on the fair market value of the Company\u2019s common stock on the date of grant, which subsequent to the IPO isdetermined based on the closing price of the Company\u2019s Class A common stock as reported on the date of grant. Prior to the IPO, the Company granted RSUs which vestupon the satisfaction of both a service condition and a performance condition.Compensation  expense  for  RSUs  with  service  and  performance  conditions  is  amortized  on  a  graded  basis  over  the  requisite  service  period  as  long  as  theperformance  condition  in  the  form  of  a  specified  liquidity  event  is  probable  to  occur.  The  liquidity  event  condition  was  satisfied  upon  the  effectiveness  of the  IPORegistration Statement on  March 28, 2019. On that date the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $857.2 million using the acceleratedattribution method for the RSUs for which the service condition was satisfied as of March 28, 2019. The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relatedto these RSUs is recorded over their remaining requisite service periods. The compensation expense for RSUs granted after March 28, 2019, which vest upon satisfaction ofa service-based condition only, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.Stock-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grantand revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates.Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded based onthe estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured usingthe enacted statutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes the effect ondeferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets tothe net amount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels ofincome, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.Under the provisions of ASC 740-10, Income Taxes, the Company evaluates uncertain tax positions by reviewing against applicable tax law for all positions takenby the Company with respect to tax years for which the statute of limitations is still open. ASC 740-10 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may berecognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based onthe technical merits. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, if any, as a component of the income tax expenseline in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.Business CombinationsThe Company accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair valueof purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date.

After the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Acquisitioncosts, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash equivalents consist of institutional money market funds and certificates of deposits denominated in U.S. dollars as well as commercial paper and corporatebonds. Cash equivalents are highly liquid, short-term investments having an original maturity of 90 days or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash. Alsoincluded in cash and cash equivalents are cash in transit from payment processors for credit and debit card transactions, which was immaterial as of each of December 31,2021 and 2020, and money market deposit accounts that are stated at cost, which approximate fair value.Restricted Cash and Cash EquivalentsRestricted cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of amounts held in separate trust accounts and restricted bank accounts as collateral for insurance purposesand amounts pledged to secure certain letters of credit.InvestmentsDebt SecuritiesThe Company\u2019s accounting for its investments in debt securities is based on the legal form of the security, the Company\u2019s intended holding period for the security,and  the  nature  of  the  transaction.  Investments  in  debt  securities  include  commercial  paper,  certificates  of  deposit,  corporate  bonds  and  U.S.  government  securities.Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value.The  Company  considers  an  available-for-sale  debt  security  to  be  impaired  if  the  fair  value  of  the  investment  is  less  than  its  amortized  cost  basis.  The  entiredifference between the amortized cost basis and the fair value of the Company\u2019s available-for-sale debt securities is recognized on the consolidated statements of operationsas an impairment if, (i) the fair value of the security is below its amortized cost and (ii) the Company intends to sell or is more likely than not required to sell the securitybefore recovery of its amortized cost basis. If neither criterion is met, the Company evaluates whether the decline in fair value is due to credit losses or other factors. Inmaking this assessment, the Company considers the extent to which the security\u2019s fair value is less than amortized cost, changes to the rating of the security by third-partyrating  agencies,  and  adverse  conditions  specific  to  the  security,  among  other  factors.  If  the  Company's  assessment  indicates  that  a  credit  loss  exists,  the  credit  loss  ismeasured  based  on  the  Company's  best  estimate  of  the  cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected.  When  developing  its  estimate  of  cash  flows  expected  to  be  collected,  theCompany  considers  all  available  information  relevant  to  the  collectability  of  the  security,  including  past  events,  current  conditions,  and  reasonable  and  supportableforecasts.Credit loss impairments are recognized through an allowance for credit losses adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the debt securities on the balance sheetwith an offsetting credit loss expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Impairments related to factors other than credit losses are recognized as an adjustment tothe amortized cost basis of the security and an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.

Although the Company deposits its cashwith multiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cashequivalents. Management believes that the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases of debt securities toinvestment-grade securities.Fair Value MeasurementsThe Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of anasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants woulduse in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurringor nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fairvalue:Level 1Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.Level 2Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputsother than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data bycorrelation or other means.Level 3Unobservable  inputs  reflecting  our  own  assumptions  incorporated  in  valuation  techniques  used  to  determine  fair  value.  These  assumptions  are  required  to  beconsistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.The carrying values of the Company\u2019s accounts payable and accrued and other liabilities approximate their respective fair values due to the short period of time topayment.Light Vehicle FleetThe Company\u2019s Light Vehicle fleet consists of bikes and scooters. Scooters are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are included in prepaid expensesand other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the scooters, which isless than 12 months. As of December 31, 2021, there were no scooters not yet placed in service. As of December 31, 2020, the cost of scooters not yet placed in service was$8.9 million. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of scooters placed in service was $15.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of scooters placedin service was not material. Depreciation expense related to scooters was $5.9 million, $7.2 million and $35.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and2019, respectively.

Due to the short-term nature of these arrangements, the Company classifies these leases as operating leases. The Company does not separate lease and non-leasecomponents, such as insurance or roadside assistance provided to the lessee, in its lessor lease arrangements. Lease payments are primarily fixed and are recognized asrevenue in the period over which the lease arrangement occurs. Taxes or other fees assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with eachlease revenue-producing transaction and collected by the Company from the lessee are excluded from the consideration in its lease arrangements. The Company mitigatesresidual value risk of its leased assets by performing regular maintenance and repairs, as necessary, and through periodic reviews of asset depreciation rates based on theCompany's ongoing assessment of present and estimated future market conditions.LesseeThe Company's leases include real estate property to support its operations and Flexdrive vehicles that may be used by drivers to provide ridesharing services onthe Lyft Platform or renters for personal reasons through Lyft Rentals. For leases with a term greater than 12 months, the Company records the related right-of-use assetand lease liability at the present value of lease payments over the term. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certainthat the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not separate lease and non-lease components of contracts for real estate property leases, but has elected todo so for vehicle leases when non-lease components exist in these arrangements. For certain leases, the Company also applies a portfolio approach to account for right-of-use assets and lease liabilities that are similar in nature and have nearly identical contract provisions.The Company\u2019s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate to discount the leasepayments based on information available at lease commencement. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that the Companywould have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in the Company\u2019s lease liability calculation. Operating leases are included inoperating lease right-of-use assets, operating lease liabilities \u2014 current and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease costs for the Company'soperating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis primarily within operating expenses over the lease term. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net,accrued and other current liabilities, and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of theestimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term in cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations. The interest component of finance leases is included incost of revenue on the consolidated statements of operations and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. Variable lease payments are recognizedprimarily in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred.Property and EquipmentProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using a straight-line method over the estimated useful life ofthe  related  asset,  which  is  generally  between two  and  seven  years.  Depreciation  for  property  and  equipment  commences  once  they  are  ready  for  our  intended  use.Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred, and improvements and betterments are capitalized.

Therewas no impairment of long-lived assets recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.Software Development CostsThe Company incurs costs related to developing the Lyft Platform and related support systems. The Company capitalizes development costs related to the LyftPlatform and related support systems once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used toperform the function intended.

The recorded liabilities reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that havebeen  incurred  but  not  yet  reported  and  any  estimable  administrative  run-out  expenses  related  to  the  processing  of  these  outstanding  claim  payments.  Liabilities  aredetermined on a quarterly basis by internal actuaries through an analysis of historical trends, changes in claims experience including consideration of new information andapplication of loss development factors among other inputs and assumptions. On an annual basis or more frequently as determined by management, an independent third-party actuary will evaluate the liabilities for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.Insurance  claims  may  take  years  to  completely  settle,  and the  Company has limited  historical  loss  experience.  Because  of the  limited  operational  history,  theCompany  makes  certain  assumptions  based  on  currently  available  information  and  industry  statistics,  with  the  loss  development  factors  as  one  of  the  most  significantassumptions, and utilizes actuarial models and techniques to estimate the reserves. A number of factors can affect the actual cost of a claim, including the length of time theclaim remains open, economic and healthcare cost trends and the results of related litigation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in future years for events that occurred in aprior year at a rate that differs from previous actuarial projections. The impact of these factors on ultimate costs for insurance is difficult to estimate and could be material.However, while the Company believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided. As aresult, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability and when amounts will be paid may significantly vary from the estimated amounts provided for onthe consolidated balance sheets. The Company continues to review its insurance estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additionalclaims are reported and settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves.Net Loss Per ShareThe Company follows the two-class method when computing net loss per common share when shares are issued that meet the definition of participating securities.The two-class method determines net loss per common share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulatedand participation rights in undistributed earnings.

There were no redeemable convertible preferred shares issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less sharessubject to repurchase. The diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period. For periods in which theCompany reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per common share attributable to commonstockholders, because potentially dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive.94", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3810, "end_char_idx": 5894, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "36e4867b-493a-4b4d-bd0a-77b8067ba2e2": {"__data__": {"id_": "36e4867b-493a-4b4d-bd0a-77b8067ba2e2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03cbb43c-7b3b-4f19-ba31-446ceb0ffa36", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "c079a2948d48791c3b15a0fcc57c9518e584a5c621f4ca9a3e142de0668fe224", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3bb0e2dd-8fda-47e7-adf0-80eadeed8fc5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "b5eb5f5ea9391aa8fc01bef289d774792ceab898edb2da3d3060bc1d13644ef4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsIn  December  2019,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  No.  2019-12,  \"Income  Taxes  (Topic  740):  Simplifying  the  Accounting  for  Income  Taxes\",  which  removes  certainexceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and improves consistent application of and simplifies GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amendingexisting guidance.

This preexisting contractual relationship and others were settled on the Closing Date as an adjustment to the purchaseprice, resulting in a total acquisition consideration paid of $13.0 million.95", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3289, "end_char_idx": 6049, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "59636c60-29fc-48ca-8bc4-aac1eed3a82e": {"__data__": {"id_": "59636c60-29fc-48ca-8bc4-aac1eed3a82e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "84afa009-6bbd-473c-b1fb-b1530f1c01a8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "96", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "ba233a55e50383edea8f8d4c380e68a3c3367cacf0da123d09edbb448038c59e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Acquisition costs were imma\nterial and are included in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.The following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the Closing Date (in thousands):Cash and cash equivalents$ 587 Prepaid expenses and other current assets276 Property and equipment111,881 Finance lease right-of-use assets56,014 Identifiable intangible assets - developed technology13,200 Total identifiable assets acquired181,958 Loans134,121 Finance lease & other liabilities57,265 Total liabilities assumed191,386 Net liabilities assumed(9,428) Goodwill22,455 Total acquisition consideration$ 13,027 Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  the  total  purchase  consideration  over  the  fair  value  of  the  underlying  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed.  Goodwill  isattributable to expected synergies and monetization opportunities from gaining control over the Flexdrive platform (\u201cdeveloped technology\u201d intangible asset) and gaininggreater flexibility in monetizing the fleet of owned and leased vehicles from the combined operations of the Company and Flexdrive. The acquisition is a taxable businesscombination for tax purposes and goodwill recognized in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes.The fair value of the developed technology intangible asset was determined to be $13.2 million with an estimated useful life of three years. The fair value of thedeveloped technology was determined using the avoided cost approach. In the avoided cost approach, the fair value of an asset is based on the future after-tax costs whichare avoided (or reduced) as a result of owning (or having the rights to) the asset for three years after the Closing Date. Indications of value were developed by discountingthese benefits to their present value.The results of operations for the acquired business have been included on the consolidated statements of operations for the period subsequent to the Company'sacquisition  of  Flexdrive.

DivestituresTransaction with Woven Planet Holdings, Inc. (\u201cWoven Planet\u201d)On July 13, 2021, the Company completed a multi-element transaction with Woven Planet, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation, for the divestiture of certainassets related to the Company\u2019s self-driving vehicle division, Level 5, as well as commercial agreements for the utilization of Lyft rideshare and fleet data to accelerate thesafety and commercialization of the automated-driving vehicles that Woven Planet is developing. The Company will receive, in total, approximately $515 million in cash inconnection with this transaction, with $165 million paid upfront and $350 million to be paid over a five-year period.The  divestiture  did  not  represent  a  strategic  shift  with  a  major  effect  on  the  Company\u2019s  operations  and  financial  results,  and  therefore,  does  not  qualify  forreporting  as  a  discontinued  operation.  As  the  transaction  included  multiple  elements,  the  Company  had  to  estimate  how  much  of  the  arrangement  consideration  wasattributable  to  the  divestiture  of  certain  assets  related  to  the  Level  5  division  and  how  much  was  attributable  to  the  commercial  agreements  for  the  utilization  of  Lyftrideshare and fleet data. The Company recognized a $119.3 million pre-tax gain for the divestiture of certain assets related to the Level 5 division, which was based on therelative fair value of the Level 5 division, valued under the replacement cost method, and the estimated standalone selling price of the rideshare and fleet data, valued usingan adjusted market approach.. The significant assumptions related to the obsolescence curve used to estimate the fair value of the Level 5 division assets and the estimatedmiles to recreate the data produced from the rideshare license used to determine the stand alone selling price of the rideshare data.

This policy is designed to minimize the Company's exposure to credit losses.

The unrealized losses recognized on marketable available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31,2021 was primarily related to the continued market volatility associated with COVID-19. The contractual terms of these investments do not permit the issuer to settle thesecurities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investments and it is not expected that the investments would be settled at a price less than their amortized costbasis. The Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery oftheir amortized cost basis.

(\u201cPVIC\u201d),  entered  into  a  Quota  Share  ReinsuranceAgreement (the \u201cReinsurance Agreement\u201d) with DARAG Bermuda LTD (\u201cDARAG\u201d), under which DARAG reinsured a legacy portfolio of auto insurance policies, basedon reserves in place as of March 31, 2021, for $183.2 million of coverage above the liabilities recorded as of that date. Under the terms of the Reinsurance Agreement,PVIC ceded to DARAG approximately $251.3 million of certain legacy insurance liabilities for policies underwritten during the period of October 1, 2018 to October 1,2020, with an aggregate limit of $434.5 million, for a premium of $271.5 million (\u201cthe Reinsurance Transaction\u201d). The Reinsurance Agreement is on a funds withheldbasis,  meaning  that  funds  are  withheld  by  PVIC  from  the  insurance  premium  owed  to  DARAG  in  order  to  pay  future  reinsurance  claims  on  DARAG\u2019s  behalf.  Uponconsummation of the Reinsurance Transaction, a reinsurance recoverable of $251.3 million was established, and since a contractual right of offset exists, the reinsurancerecoverable has been netted against the funds withheld liability balance of $271.5 million for a $20.2 million net funds withheld liability balance included in accrued andother current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. In addition to the initial funds withheld balance of $271.5 million, additional coverage of certain legacy insuranceliabilities is collateralized by a trust account established by DARAG for the benefit of PVIC, which was $75.0 million upon consummation. As of December 31, 2021, thebalance  of  the  net  funds  withheld  liability  is  zero.  A  loss  of  approximately  $20.4  million  for  the  total  cost  of  the  Reinsurance  Transaction  was  recognized  on  theconsolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, with $20.2 million in cost of revenue and $0.2 million in general and administrative expenses.The Reinsurance Transaction does not discharge PVIC of its obligations to the policyholder. Management evaluated reinsurance counterparty credit risk and doesnot consider it to be material since the premium of $271.5 million was retained by PVIC on a funds withheld basis on behalf of the reinsurer.Other Income (Expense), NetThe following table sets forth the primary components of other income (expense), net as reported on the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):Year Ended December 31, 20212020 2019 Interest income$ 9,074 $43,654 $102,506 Gain (loss) on sale of securities, net687 (868) 246 Foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net788 1,818 (523) Sublease income6,624 \u2014 \u2014 Gain from transaction with Woven Planet119,284 \u2014 \u2014 Other, net(524) (935) 366 Other income (expense), net$ 135,933 $43,669 $102,595 _______________(1)Interest income was reported as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations in periods prior to the second quarter of 2020.(1)102", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4072, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "96b7793a-43e2-4a5f-a862-def84a717036": {"__data__": {"id_": "96b7793a-43e2-4a5f-a862-def84a717036", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "88cae90f-2aa7-4a73-8668-90f720c93ec4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "103", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "8af2a919c8a976ce9ede774fddf60746d0db35902a1837a3aeef788ff55b8f33", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7.

The investment had a carrying value of $64.0 million and is categorized as Level 3.

LeasesReal Estate Operating LeasesThe Company leases real estate property at approximately 81 locations of which all leases have commenced as of December 31, 2021. These leases are classifiedas operating leases. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining lease terms vary from one month to eight years. For certain leases the Company has options to extend the leaseterm  for  periods  varying  from  two  months  to  ten  years.  These  renewal  options  are  not  considered  in  the  remaining  lease  term  unless  it  is  reasonably  certain  that  theCompany will exercise such options. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or longer, the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability representingthe fixed component of the lease payment. Any fixed payments related to non-lease components, such as common area maintenance  or other services provided by thelandlord, are accounted for as a component of the lease payment and therefore, a part of the total lease cost.Flexdrive ProgramThe Company operates a fleet of rental vehicles through Flexdrive, a portion of which are leased from third-party vehicle leasing companies. These leases areclassified as finance leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining lease terms varybetween one month to three years. These leases generally do not contain any non-lease components and, as such, all payments due under these arrangements are allocated tothe respective lease component.104", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3278, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b2d2c0fd-713a-4715-b8ad-674ea95ceb06": {"__data__": {"id_": "b2d2c0fd-713a-4715-b8ad-674ea95ceb06", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9d1857a1-3fde-41e7-8ff3-fb0f9ea24195", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "105", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "c1218fef75161fb393d02deb79955ae3e5220bb76bc41b68e7bec42062cace3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Lease Position as of December 31, 2021\nThe table below presents the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands, except for remaining lease terms andpercentages):December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Operating LeasesAssetsOperating lease right-of-use assets$ 223,412 $275,756 LiabilitiesOperating lease liabilities, current$ 53,765 $49,291 Operating lease liabilities, non-current210,232 265,803 Total operating lease liabilities$ 263,997 $315,094 Finance LeasesAssetsFinance lease right-of-use assets$ 26,802 $28,108 LiabilitiesFinance lease liabilities, current13,556 20,795 Finance lease liabilities, non-current14,242 6,593 Total finance lease liabilities$ 27,798 $27,388 Weighted-average remaining lease term (years)Operating leases5.6 6.3 Finance leases2.2 1.5 Weighted-average discount rateOperating leases6.3 %6.4 %Finance leases2.8 %4.7 %_______________(1)This  balance  is  included  within  property  and  equipment,  net  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  was  primarily  related  to  leases  acquired  in  the  Flexdrive  transaction.

Under  the  amended  arrangement,  the  Company  committed  to  spend  an  aggregate  of  at  least  $300  million  between  January  2019  and  June  2022,  with  aminimum amount of $80 million in each of the three contractual periods, on services with AWS. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has made payments in excess of$300 million under the amended arrangement.In  November  2018,  the  Company  completed  the  acquisition  of  Motivate,  a  New  York  headquartered  bikeshare  company.  Over  the  approximately  five  yearsfollowing  the  transaction,  the  Company  committed  to invest  an  aggregate  of  $100  million  in  the  bikeshare  program  for  the  New  York  metro  area.  The  Company  alsoassumed  certain  pre-existing  contractual  obligations  to  increase  the  bike  fleets  in  other  locations  which  are  not  considered  to  be  material.

The Company has agreed toindemnify and defend the indemnified party\u2019s claims and related losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party resulting from actual or threatened third-party claimsbecause of the Company\u2019s activities or, in some cases, non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by the Company. It is not possible to determine themaximum  potential  loss  under  these  indemnification  provisions  due  to  the  Company\u2019s  limited  history  of  prior  indemnification  claims  and  the  unique  facts  andcircumstances involved in each particular provision. To date, losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations in connection with the indemnification provisionshave not been material.Legal ProceedingsThe Company is currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations in theordinary course of business, including suits by drivers, riders, renters, or third parties (individually or as class actions) alleging, among other things, various wage andexpense related claims, violations of state or federal laws, improper disclosure of the Company\u2019s fees, rules or policies, that such fees, rules or policies violate applicablelaw,  or  that  the  Company  has  not  acted  in  conformity  with  such  fees,  rules  or  policies,  as  well  as  proceedings  related  to  product  liability,  its  acquisitions,  securitiesissuances or business practices, or public disclosures about the business. In addition, the Company has been, and is currently, named as a defendant in a number of litigationmatters related to accidents or other trust and safety incidents involving drivers or riders using the Lyft Platform.The outcomes of the Company\u2019s legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For some matters for which a material lossis  reasonably  possible,  an  estimate  of  the  amount  of  loss  or  range  of  losses  is  not  possible  nor  is  the  Company  able  to  estimate  the  loss  or  range  of  losses  that  couldpotentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of legal matters, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of theamount recorded.Independent Contractor Classification MattersWith regard to independent contractor classification of drivers on the Lyft Platform, the Company is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings,administrative actions, government investigations and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state and municipal levels challenging the classification of thesedrivers as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, the Company has violated various labor and other laws that would apply to driveremployees.  Laws  and  regulations  that  govern  the  status  and  classification  of  independent  contractors  are  subject  to  change  and  divergent  interpretations  by  variousauthorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for the Company.For  example,  Assembly  Bill  5  (as  codified  in  part  at  Cal.  Labor  Code  sec.  2750.3)  codified  and  extended  an  employment  classification  test  set  forth  by  theCalifornia Supreme Court that established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill led to additional challenges tothe independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform. For example, on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General and the City Attorneys of LosAngeles,  San  Diego  and  San  Francisco  filed  a  lawsuit  against  the  Company  and  Uber  for  allegedly  misclassifying  drivers  on  the  companies\u2019  respective  platforms  asindependent  contractors  in  violation  of  Assembly  Bill  5  and  California\u2019s  Unfair  Competition  Law,  and  on  August  5,  2020,  the  California  Labor  Commissioner  filedlawsuits against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers on the companies\u2019 respective platforms as independent contractors, seeking injunctive reliefand material damages and penalties.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4703, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94ad72cd-2106-421d-b9ef-778d5c2ffeda": {"__data__": {"id_": "94ad72cd-2106-421d-b9ef-778d5c2ffeda", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c2289dba-5401-4798-b98c-c2d2dae3fb26", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "a826c59c8be625d58ca82d1c22f0054ee5e4388f4691751fe81c94606fdd2cd0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7e27ba18-2502-4670-bfdd-759491a7b820", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "108", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "5ab736eede6fc19f7a4f2f3f3c4a78ee4887c770c15fa876b81c2fdf2a442267", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The passage of this bill led to additional challenges tothe independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft Platform.

On August 10, 2020, the court granted a motion for a preliminary injunction, forcing the Company and Uber to reclassify drivers inCalifornia as employees until the end of the lawsuit. Subsequently, voters in California approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provided a framework fordrivers utilizing platforms like Lyft to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020. OnApril 20, 2021, the court granted the parties\u2019 joint request to dissolve the preliminary injunction in light of the passage of Proposition 22. On May 3, 2021, the CaliforniaLabor Commissioner filed a petition to coordinate its lawsuit with the Attorney General lawsuit and three other cases against the Company and Uber. The coordinationpetition was granted and the coordinated cases have been assigned to a judge in San Francisco Superior Court. On January 12, 2021, a separate lawsuit was filed in theCalifornia Supreme Court against the State of California alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional under the California Constitution. The California Supreme Courtdenied review on February 3, 2021. Plaintiffs then filed a similar lawsuit in Alameda County Superior Court on February 12, 2021. Protect App-Based Drivers & Services(PADS) -- the coalition that established and operated the official ballot measure committee that successfully advocated for the passage of Proposition 22 -- intervened in theAlameda lawsuit. On August 20, 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda Superior Court issued an order finding that Proposition 22 is unenforceable. Both the CaliforniaAttorney General and PADS have filed appeals to the California Court of Appeal. Briefing is currently underway. Separately, on July 14, 2020, the Massachusetts AttorneyGeneral filed a lawsuit against the Company and Uber for allegedly misclassifying drivers as independent contractors under Massachusetts law, and seeking declaratory andinjunctive relief. The Company and Uber filed motions to dismiss, which were denied by the court in March 2021.

Certain adverse outcomes of such actions would have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial conditionand  results  of  operations,  including  damages,  penalties  and  potential  suspension  of  operations  in  impacted  jurisdictions,  including  California  or  Massachusetts.  TheCompany\u2019s chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.

The Company is currently  defending  allegations  in a number of lawsuits  that  the Company has failed  to properlyclassify drivers and provide those drivers with sick leave and related benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company\u2019s chances of success on the merits are stilluncertain and any possible loss or range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.The  Company  disputes  any  allegations  of  wrongdoing  and  intends  to  continue  to  defend  itself  vigorously  in  these  matters.

There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in the Company\u2019s opinion, is likely tohave  a  material  impact  on  its  business,  financial  condition  or  results  of  operations;  however,  results  of  litigation  and  claims  are  inherently  unpredictable  and  legalproceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.For example, on January 17, 2020, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted the petition of multiple plaintiffs to coordinate their claims relating toalleged  sexual  assault  or  harassment  by  drivers  on  the  Lyft  Platform,  and  a  Judicial  Council  Coordinated  Proceeding  has  been  created  before  the  Superior  Court  ofCalifornia, County of San Francisco, where the claims of these and other plaintiffs are currently pending.

The putative class actions have been consolidated into two putative class actions, one in California state court and the other infederal court. The derivative actions have also been consolidated into one action in federal court in California. On July 1, 2020, the California state court sustained in partand overruled in part the Company's demurrer to the consolidated complaint. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on August 3, 2020. On February26, 2021, the California state court struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend, and plaintiffs filed an amendedcomplaint on March 17, 2021. The Company filed its demurrer and motion to strike the amended claim on April 13, 2021, and on July 16, 2021, the California state courtoverruled the demurrer but struck additional allegations from the consolidated complaint and granted plaintiffs leave to amend. The state court plaintiffs filed their renewedmotion to certify a class action on June 24, 2021, and on January 25, 2022, the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion without prejudice and stayed the case in light of the certifiedclass action proceeding in federal court. In the California federal court class action, on May 14, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaintand on September 8, 2020, the federal court granted in part and denied in part that motion. The Company filed its answer to this consolidated complaint on October 2, 2020,and the court certified the class action on August 20, 2021, and set trial to commence on December 5, 2022. On February 8, 2022, the parties informed the court they hadreached an agreement in principle to settle the case on a class-wide basis.

The Company believes that, based on a number of factors, the available objective evidence creates sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability ofthe deferred tax assets such that a valuation allowance has been recorded. These factors include the Company\u2019s history of net losses since its inception.As of December 31, 2021, the Company had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7.5 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively.The federal net operating loss carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 expire at various dates beginning in 2030 and will continue to expire through2037, while federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 or later do not expire. The state net operating loss carryovers will begin to expire in 2022 and willcontinue to expire at various times depending upon individual state carryforward rules. Utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various limitationsdue to the ownership change limitations provided by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 382 and similar state provisions.The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. All net operating losses generated to date are subject to adjustment forU.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Additionally, all tax years remain open to examination as of December 31, 2021.The Company has not provided foreign  withholding  taxes  on the  undistributed  earnings  of its  foreign  subsidiaries  as of December  31, 2021, 2020, and 2019,because it intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside of the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability will beimmaterial, due to the participation exemption put in place by the 2017 Tax Act.The Company\u2019s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interestand penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company\u2019s consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized any interest and penalties in itsconsolidated statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties.

Net Loss Per Share\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less sharessubject  to  repurchase.

A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefitsof controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance thatall control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and thatbreakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or morepeople or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events,and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequatebecause of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.Item 9B. Other Information.None.Item 9C.

claims, disputes or controversies between  Lyft and me that arise out of or are related in any way to myemployment relationship with Lyft (except those excluded below) shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration. For purposes of this MutualArbitration Agreement (the \"Arbitration Agreement\"), references to Lyft shall include Lyft, Inc., and/or any entity affiliated with or related to Lyft,Inc. (including their owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, and allsuccessors and assigns of any of them). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after the Agreementterminates or my relationship with Lyft ends. Any  arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individual basis; classarbitrations and class actions are not permitted. Lyft and I further expressly waive the right to a jury trial, and Lyft and I agree that thearbitrator's award will be final and binding on both parties.This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. The types of disputes and claims covered by this Arbitration Agreement (referredto below as \"Claims\") include, but are not limited to disputes over rights provided by federal, state, or local statutes, regulations, ordinances, andcommon  law;  claims  related  to  salary,  overtime,  bonuses,  vacation,  paid  time  off,  wages,  meal  and  rest  breaks,  and  any  other  form  ofcompensation;  claims  for  breach  of  contract,  wrongful  discharge,  fraud,  defamation,  emotional distress,  retaliation  and  breach  of  the  impliedcovenant of good faith and fair dealing; and claims involving laws that prohibit discrimination  and unlawful harassment based on any protectedclassification, including claims under Title Vll of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Age Discrimination inEmployment  Act,  the  Older  Workers  Benefit  Protection  Act,  and  any  state  employment  statutes,  such  as  the  California  Fair  Employment  &Housing Act, and the California Labor Code.2.Disputes Excluded From ArbitrationThis  Arbitration  Agreement  does  not  cover  claims  for  disability  and  medical  benefits  under  workers'  compensation  laws  or  claims  forunemployment benefits. Likewise, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prohibits me from filing an administrative charge with the federal EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission,U.S.  Department  of  Labor,  Securities  Exchange  Commission,  National  Labor  Relations  Board,  the  Office  of  Federal  Contract  CompliancePrograms, the California Department of Fair Employment & Housing, or any other similar local, state, or federal agency, or from participating inany administrative agency investigation. Notwithstanding this Arbitration Provision, either Lyft or I may seek to obtain injunctive relief in court toavoid irreparable harm that might take place prior to the resolution of any arbitration.3.Class Action/Collective Action WaiverLyft and I agree to bring any Claims in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis. Accordingly, neither Inor Lyft shall bring, nor shall the arbitrator preside over, any form  of class or collective proceeding. In addition, unless all parties agree inwriting otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of more than one employee. Neither  I nor Lyft may seek, normay the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other employees.Notwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this sectionmay  be  resolved  only  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  and  not  by  an  arbitrator. If a  court  decides  that  applicable  law  does  not  permit  theenforcement of any of this section's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from thearbitration and may be brought in court.4.Representative PAGA WaiverTo  the  fullest  extent  permitted  by  law,  Lyft  and  I  (1) agree  not  to  bring  a  representative  action  on  behalf  of  others  under  the  PrivateAttorneys General Act of 2004 (\"PAGA\"), California Labor Code \u00a7 2698 et seq., in", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4464, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "daf80a9a-63cb-450d-9c58-fbbed60abb15": {"__data__": {"id_": "daf80a9a-63cb-450d-9c58-fbbed60abb15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "165", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ea47c3f8-99ae-47de-8733-660f603b4cf5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "165", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "55abe0100feca85e60f899125b129037197e589cef6165db0fd6f14e7ca674db", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "any\n court or in arbitration, and (2) agree that for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only (i.e., to resolve whether I have personally been aggrieved orsubject to any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collectiveproceeding (i.e., to resolve whether other individuals have been aggrieved or subject to any violations of law) (collectively, \"representative PAGAWaiver\").

Lyft will pay any coststhat are unique to the arbitration process, including fees for the arbitrator's time and use of an arbitration forum. I will pay any costs that I amrequired to pay under the AAA rules that would be imposed on me in a judicial forum, but in no event shall the AAA filing fee that I amresponsible for paying exceed the filing fees that I would have paid if I had filed a complaint in a court of law having jurisdiction.

For purposes of this MutualArbitration Agreement (the \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d), references to Lyft shall include Lyft, Inc., and/or any entity affiliated with or related toLyft, Inc. (including their owners, officers, directors, managers, employees, agents, fiduciaries, administrators, affiliates, subsidiaries, parents,and all successors and assigns of any of them). This Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and survives after theAgreement terminates or my relationship with Lyft ends. Any  arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement will take place on an individualbasis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. Lyft and I further expressly waive the right to a jury trial, and Lyft and Iagree that the arbitrator's award will be final and binding on both parties.This  Arbitration  Agreement  is  intended  to  be  broadly  interpreted.  The  types  of  disputes  and  claims  covered  by  this  Arbitration  Agreement(referred  to  below  as  \u201cClaims\u201d)  include,  but  are  not  limited  to  disputes  over  rights  provided  by  federal,  state,  or  local  statutes,  regulations,ordinances, and common law; claims related to salary, overtime, bonuses, vacation, paid time off, wages, meal and rest breaks, and any otherform  of  compensation;  claims  for  breach  of  contract,  wrongful  discharge,  fraud,  defamation,  emotional  distress,  retaliation  and  breach  of  theimplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and claims involving laws that prohibit discrimination and unlawful harassment based on anyprotected  classification,  including  claims  under  Title  VII  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964,  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  the  AgeDiscrimination in Employment Act, the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, and any state employment statutes, such as the California FairEmployment & Housing Act, and the California Labor Code.2.Disputes Excluded From ArbitrationThis  Arbitration  Agreement  does  not  cover  claims  for  disability  and  medical  benefits  under  workers\u2019  compensation  laws  or  claims  forunemployment benefits. Likewise, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement prohibits me from filing an administrative charge with the federal EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission,U.S.  Department  of  Labor,  Securities  Exchange  Commission,  National  Labor  Relations  Board,  the  Office  of  Federal  Contract  CompliancePrograms, the California Department of Fair Employment & Housing, or any other similar local, state, or federal agency, or from participating inany administrative agency investigation. Notwithstanding this Arbitration Provision, either Lyft or I may seek to obtain injunctive relief in courtto avoid irreparable harm that might take place prior to the resolution of any arbitration.3.Class Action/Collective Action WaiverLyft and I agree to bring any Claims in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis. Accordingly, neitherI nor Lyft shall bring, nor shall the arbitrator preside over, any form of class or collective proceeding. In addition, unless all partiesagree in writing otherwise, the arbitrator shall not consolidate or join the arbitrations of more than one employee. Neither  I nor Lyft mayseek, nor may the arbitrator award, any relief that is not individualized to the claimant or that affects other employees.Notwithstanding any other provision of this Arbitration Agreement, the scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this sectionmay be resolved only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. If a court decides that applicable law does not permit theenforcement of any of this section\u2019s limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from thearbitration and may be brought in court.4.Representative PAGA WaiverTo the fullest extent permitted by law, Lyft and I (1) agree not to bring a representative action on behalf of others under the Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (\u201cPAGA\u201d), California Labor Code \u00a7 2698 et seq ., in", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4439, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "090b3996-7289-42c1-ab87-b3fa2a2ed6bf": {"__data__": {"id_": "090b3996-7289-42c1-ab87-b3fa2a2ed6bf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "4b0eb44e-d5fe-4c89-ba2d-18fb5af19677", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "206", "file_name": "lyft_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/lyft_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1440303, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "0040fb3e10f9514f721d96b06631d7e0bf89584398a84c0ae2c8962ff493e12d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "any court or\n in arbitration, and (2) agree that for any claim brought on a private attorney general basis, including under the California PAGA, any such dispute shall be resolved in arbitration on an individual basis only ( i.e., to resolve whether I have personally been aggrieved or subjectto any violations of law), and that such an action may not be used to resolve the claims or rights of other individuals in a single or collectiveproceeding  (i.e.,  to  resolve  whether  other  individuals  have  been  aggrieved  or  subject  to  any  violations  of  law)  (collectively,  \u201crepresentativePAGA  Waiver\u201d).

The arbitrator, in his or her sole discretion, may permit any discovery necessary to allow either party to have a fair opportunity to pursuethat party\u2019s claims and defenses.6.Paying For The ArbitrationThe AAA\u2019s rules will govern the amount and allocation of fees for the arbitration, subject to the provisions of this section. Lyft will pay any coststhat are unique to the arbitration process, including fees for the arbitrator\u2019s time and use of an arbitration forum. I will pay any costs that I amrequired to pay under the AAA rules that would be imposed on me in a judicial forum, but in no event shall the AAA filing fee that I amresponsible for paying exceed the filing fees that I would have paid if I had filed a complaint in a court of law having jurisdiction.

These obligations shall not apply toinformation that (i) is now a part of public knowledge or literature or is generally known in the industry; or (ii) hereafter becomes a part of the publicknowledge or generally known in the industry from a source other than Employee, either directly or indirectly.

In addition, if Employee files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, Employee may disclose a trade secret to Employee\u2019s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding,provided the document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and Employee does not otherwise disclose the trade secret except pursuant tocourt order.

Employee agrees that if Employee, Employee\u2019s attorney, or Employee\u2019saccountant, financial advisor or spouse/domestic partner breaches the promise to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement and the SeverancePay, then the resulting damage to the Company would be impracticable or extremely difficult to determine because of the uncertain effect of thedisclosure of such information on the Company\u2019s present and future business prospects. Because of the difficulty of determining the damagesresulting from any such breach of the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, the parties agree that in the event of such a breach by Employeeeither directly by Employee or indirectly through Employee\u2019s spouse, attorney or agents, Employee shall be obligated to re-pay to the Company thesum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) as liquidated damages for each occurrence, which amount Employee agrees is reasonable.

Employee\u2019s cooperation inconnection with such claims, actions, or investigations will include, but not be limited to, being available to meet with the Company\u2019s counsel toprepare for discovery or any legal proceeding, executing documents, and providing truthful testimony as a witness on behalf of the Company atmutually convenient times. The Company will reimburse Employee for all reasonable, pre-approved out-of-pocket costs and expenses (but notincluding attorneys\u2019 fees) that Employee incurs in connection with obligations under this paragraph.14.Non-Disparagement.
