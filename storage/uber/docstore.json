Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe  world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category position in its respective market.DeliveryOur  Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform. In addition to benefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.During 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (\u201cCornershop\u201d) in an all-stock transaction. Theacquisition was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop.

Freight leverages our proprietary technology, brand awareness, and experience revolutionizingindustries to connect carriers with shippers on our platform, and gives carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. The freight industryis highly fragmented  and deeply inefficient.  It can take several  hours, sometimes  days, for shippers to find a truck and driver  for shipments,  with most of theprocess conducted over the phone or by fax. Procurement is highly fragmented, with traditional players relying on local or regional offices to book shipments. It isequally  difficult  for  carriers  to  find  and  book  the  shipments  that  work  for  their  businesses,  spending  hours  on  the  phone  negotiating  pricing  and  terms.  Theseinefficiencies adversely impact both shippers and carriers, and contribute to the number of non-revenue or \u201cdead-head\u201d miles,4", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3527, "end_char_idx": 5900, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "906d4d7a-c6ca-4774-8f0c-2268bfad4557": {"__data__": {"id_": "906d4d7a-c6ca-4774-8f0c-2268bfad4557", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "83d08579-e17b-4e50-8f79-8ad6ccf06bda", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "167549b647408ab46dbefb9cc1437478c2d1ae35dee68cbd51c8f2d83a2a9c32", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "1ff3ce1a-bbd1-4683-84b9-2c98ef758564", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "791beb7254aff136eabd8b210169f66ba4c9f28d6071525266779f1b3f50aaea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "which\n are miles driven by carriers between shipments.

Together, these elements powermovement from point A to point B.Massive NetworkOur massive, efficient, and intelligent network consists of tens of millions of Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers and carriers, as well as underlying data, technology, and shared infrastructure. Our network becomes smarter with every trip.In approximately 10,500 cities around the world (as of January 1, 2022), our network powers movement at the touch of abutton for millions, and we hope eventually billions, of people.Leading TechnologyWe  have built proprietary marketplace, routing, and payments technologies. Marketplace technologies are the core of ourdeep  technology  advantage  and  include  demand  prediction,  matching  and  dispatching,  and  pricing  technologies.  Ourtechnologies make it extremely efficient to launch new businesses and operationalize existing ones.Operational ExcellenceOur  regional on-the-ground operations teams use their extensive market-specific knowledge to rapidly launch and scaleproducts in cities, support Drivers, consumers, Merchants, shippers, and carriers, and build and enhance relationships withcities and regulators.Product ExpertiseOur  products are built with the expertise that allows us to set the standard for powering movement on-demand, provideplatform users with a contextual, intuitive interface, continually evolve features and functionality, and deliver safety andtrust.We intend to continue to invest in new platform offerings that we believe will further strengthen our platform and existing offerings.We  believe  that  all  of  these  synergies  serve  the  customer  experience,  enabling  us  to  attract  new  platform  users  and  to  deepen  engagement  with  existingplatform users. Both of these dynamics grow our network scale and liquidity, which further increases the value of our platform to platform users. For example,Delivery attracts new consumers to our network\u2014for the three months ended December 31, 2021, over 60% of first-time Delivery consumers were new to ourplatform.  Additionally,  for  the  three  months  ended  December  31,  2021,  consumers  who  used  both  Mobility  and  Delivery  generated  12.6  Trips  per  month  onaverage, compared  to 5.0 Trips per month on average for consumers who used a single offering  in cities where both Mobility  and Delivery were offered. Webelieve that these trends will improve as we further leverage the power of our platform.With our platform, we are making it even easier for our consumers to unlock convenience. During November 2021, we launched Uber One in the UnitedStates as our single cross-platform membership program that brings together the best of Uber. Uber One members have access to discounts, special pricing, priorityservice, and exclusive perks across our rides, delivery and grocery offerings. Our Uber Pass and Eats Pass membership programs continue to remain available inselect cities as a subscription offering.

Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules,and  regulations,  including  those  related  to  Internet  activities,  privacy,  cybersecurity,  data  protection,  intellectual  property,  competition,  consumer  protection,payments, labor and employment, transportation services, transportation network companies, licensing regulations and taxation. These laws and regulations areconstantly evolving and may be interpreted, applied, created, or amended, in a manner that could harm our business. Examples of certain laws and regulations weare subject to are described below.MobilityOur  platform,  and  in  particular  our  Mobility  products,  are  subject  to  differing,  and  sometimes  conflicting,  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  the  numerousjurisdictions  in  which  we  operate.  A  large  number  of  proposals  are  before  various  national,  regional,  and  local  legislative  bodies  and  regulatory  entities,  bothwithin the United States and in foreign jurisdictions, regarding issues related to our business model.In the United States, many state and local laws, rules, and regulations impose legal restrictions and other requirements on operating our Mobility products,including licensing, insurance, screening, and background check requirements. Outside of the United States, certain jurisdictions have adopted similar laws, rules,and  regulations  while  other  jurisdictions  have  not  adopted  any  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  which  govern  our  Mobility  business.  Further,  certain  jurisdictions,including Argentina, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, and Spain, six countries that we have identified as expansion markets, have adopted laws, rules, andregulations banning certain ridesharing products or imposing extensive operational restrictions. This uncertainty and fragmented regulatory environment createssignificant complexities for our business and operating model.Substantially  all  states  in the  United  States and numerous  municipalities  in the  United  States  and around  the  world have adopted  Transportation  NetworkCompany (\u201cTNC\u201d) regulations.

For example, California\u2019s AssemblyBill  5  (\u201cAB5\u201d),  which  went  into  effect  in  January  2020,  codified  a  test  to  determine  whether  a  worker  is  an  employee  under  California  law.  The  CaliforniaAttorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint under AB5, alleging that drivers aremisclassified,  and sought  an injunction  and  monetary  damages  related  to  the  alleged  competitive  advantage  caused  by  the  alleged  misclassification  of  drivers.Although the Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors during the pendency of the lawsuit,the parties were granted a stipulation to dissolve the injunction in April 2021. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California stateballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and weexpect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to complywith the provisions of Proposition 22.

In November2019,  TfL  declined  to  issue  us  a  license,  finding  that  we  were  not  \u201cfit  and  proper,\u201d  including  with  respect  to  confidence  in  our  change  and  releasemanagement processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster Magistrates Court granted us an 18 month operating license onlargely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person.\u2022Since April 2019, Mexico City\u2019s Secretar\u00eda de Movilidad passed several amendments to existing ridesharing regulations implementing certain operationalrequirements, including a prohibition on the use of cash to pay for ridesharing services and, effective as of November 2019, a comprehensive TNC datasharing  requirement  and  a  requirement  that  Drivers  in  Mexico  City  obtain  additional  licenses  and  annual  vehicle  inspections  to  provide  ridesharingservices. Except for the vehicle inspection, we obtained an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification,could have a negative impact on our business and our failure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operatein Mexico City.\u2022In January 2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait timesbefore riders could be picked up by ridesharing drivers. In March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via a taxi product.\u2022In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a capon the number of new vehicle licenses issued to drivers who offer for-hire services. In December 2018, New York City also established a standard fortime and distance designed to establish a minimum pay standard for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers on our platform. As another example, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services onour  platform  that  went  into  effect  on  January  1,  2021,  and  other  jurisdictions  have  in  the  past  considered  or  may  consider  regulations  which  wouldimplement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.

Ourintellectual property includes the content of our website, mobile applications, registered domain names, software code, firmware, hardware and hardware designs,registered and unregistered trademarks, trademark applications, copyrights, trade secrets, inventions (whether or not patentable), patents, and patent applications.To protect our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret laws, contractual provisions, end-user policies,and disclosure restrictions. Upon discovery of potential infringement of our intellectual property, we assess and when necessary, take action to protect our rights asappropriate. We also enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and seek to control access to,and distribution of, our proprietary information in a commercially prudent manner.Research and DevelopmentBecause the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances, our ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon ourability  to  ensure  a  continual  and  timely  flow  of  competitive  new  offerings  and  technologies.

We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of theCOVID-19  pandemic  and  related  restrictions,  which  altered  typical  travel  patterns.  We  expect  that  seasonality  will  eventually  return  to  its  historic  patterns  asrecovery from the pandemic continues.DeliveryWe typically expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the first and fourth quarters compared to the second and third quarters, although thehistorical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and relatedrestrictions, which accelerated the growth of Delivery in 2021 as cities impose various dining restrictions.Human Capital at UberEmployeesWe  are  a  global  company  and  as  of  December  31,  2021,  we  and  our  subsidiaries  had  approximately  29,300  employees  globally  and  operations  inapproximately  72  countries  and  approximately  10,500  cities  around  the  world.

For example, our return-to-office plan, which will provide employees with more flexibility to work from home post-pandemic, was createdbased on employee feedback.

A diverse set of people choose to use our platform to earn income without having to apply for, or work the fixed schedules associated with,traditional employment. We believe this flexibility is an improvement over traditional work schedules and is something we believe can and should remain availableto anyone who chooses platform-based work. Uber monitors regional and global driver attraction, retention and satisfaction rates.Accessible,  flexible,  independent  work  has  offered  an  option  for  many  workers  historically  marginalized  from  the  labor  market  and  has  enabled  widegeographic coverage and reliable service offerings for consumers. However, it is increasingly clear that more can be done to improve the experience of using anapp to connect with work opportunities. Although the situation varies across countries and cities, the benefits and protections for independent workers are generallypatchy compared with those that employees receive. The current binary system of employment classification under some legal frameworks means that a worker iseither an employee who is provided significant social benefits or an independent worker who has access to relatively few. This does not have to be the case. AtUber, we believe that being your own boss should not have to come at the expense of security and dignity in work. Around the world, Uber has found innovativeways to address these issues.\u2022Advocacy: We have advocated for wider policy solutions to improve access to protections and benefits for independent workers. We believe all workshould be treated equally. We also believe that legislative reform is needed to modernize the social safety net. This includes requiring Uber\u2014and otherapp based companies\u2014to provide benefits and protections to their users without compromising the flexibility of their use of the app. Some examples ofour advocacy to preserve flexibility of work while expanding access to benefits and protections are as follows:\u25e6In  the  United  States,  European  Union,  and  Canada,  we  put  forward  proposals  to  improve  the  quality  of  independent  work,  calling  onpolicymakers, platform companies, and social representatives to work together on a new approach to platform work\u2014one where having accessto protections and benefits doesn\u2019t come at the cost of flexibility and job creation.\u25e6In California, we welcomed  the passage of Proposition 22, which introduced new requirements  for platform companies  like Uber to providebenefits, including healthcare stipends, injury protection insurance, and safety training, and implemented its requirements.\u25e6In the UK, we announced that all UK drivers will be treated as workers and receive additional rights and protections going forward. Pursuant tothis change, drivers who use Uber\u2019s platform in the UK will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working, be paidholiday pay, and will be enrolled into a pension plan if eligible. We have also announced a partnership with labor union GMB to provide an evenstronger voice to drivers and to raise the standard of flexible work across the industry.\u2022Protections  and benefits:  We  partner  with  leading  insurance  companies  around  the  world  to  pioneer  protections  for  independent  workers,  includingimplementing additional protections and benefits for Drivers in California pursuant to the passage of Proposition 22.\u2022Earnings:  We  are  continually  developing  new  technology  that  Drivers  can  use  to  acquire  information  that  may  help  them  save  on  costs  and  makeinformed choices about where and when to drive (based on when and where their earnings potential is highest).\u2022Progression:  We  have  partnered  with  Arizona  State  University  to  offer  eligible  Drivers  and  their  family  members  access  to  over  100  undergraduatedegree programs, courses in English language learning, or a certificate in entrepreneurship. Through our partnership with Arizona State University, over4,000 Drivers and their family members have enrolled in an undergraduate degree program.\u2022Engagement: We are focused on listening to and responding to the ideas and concerns of Drivers and Merchants who use our platform.

If  we  are  not  successful  in  suchproceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on ourbusiness and financial condition.Changes  to  foreign,  state,  and  local  laws  governing  the  definition  or  classification  of  independent  contractors,  or  judicial  decisions  regarding  independentcontractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation ofDrivers by labor unions. For example, California\u2019s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs havebrought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees. For example, in May 2020, the California AttorneyGeneral, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers aremisclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers. InAugust 2020, the San Francisco Superior Court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining Uber and Lyft from classifying drivers as independent contractors duringthe  pendency  of  the  lawsuit,  and  while  the  California  Court  of  Appeal  subsequently  affirmed  the  lower  court\u2019s  ruling,  on  April  12,  2021,  the  parties  filed  astipulation to dissolve the injunction, which was granted on April 16, 2021.In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms likeours for independent  work. Proposition 22 went into  effect  in December  2020 and we expect  that Drivers  will  be able  to maintain  their  status as independentcontractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation todissolve the California Attorney General\u2019s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relatingto periods before the effective date of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft,alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction. If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, wemay be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicialdecisions,  we  are  required  to  classify  Drivers  as  employees,  we  would  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expensesassociated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, socialsecurity contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additionalcosts; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of all competitors raising prices. Additionally, we may not haveadequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof the Drivers currently using our platform. Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequentlyhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Another  example  of  a  recent  judicial  decision  relating  to  Driver  classification  is  the  Aslam,  Farrar,  Hoy  and  Mithu  v.  Uber  B.V.,  et  al.  ruling  by  theEmployment Appeal Tribunal in the United Kingdom, subsequently upheld by the UK Supreme Court, that found that the plaintiff Drivers were workers (ratherthan  self-employed).", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4763, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa9d444b-55cc-40d1-b328-ae2f2cc79eea": {"__data__": {"id_": "fa9d444b-55cc-40d1-b328-ae2f2cc79eea", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9f0ca19b-dd37-41ae-a42c-2e750579834a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "5a8ebe1b00d0abf5c3fde8fa13def3f82d1a7914ea105d0913baa6fec949f499", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4a029e7a-b396-4705-88c6-f1519acc25ee", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "16", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "f23c673b36fa00728c6802824502acc1bdab6b61fea4ec4b77d951a327719efb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Additionally, we may not haveadequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majorityof the Drivers currently using our platform.

Subsequent  to the  UK Supreme  Court\u2019s  ruling,  we announced  that  we will  treat  all  UK drivers  as \u201cworkers\u201d  under  UK labor  law, goingforward. Pursuant to this change, Mobility drivers that use our platform will earn at least the National Living Wage for time spent actively working and be paidholiday pay, and eligible drivers will be enrolled into a pension plan. Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that adriver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a \u201csubordinate relationship\u201d of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the FrenchSupreme  Court  that  reclassified  an  UberX  Driver  as  an  employee  (which  has  been  followed  by  inconsistent  appellate  decisions  regarding  employee  status),decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recentSpanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers areemployees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.In  addition,  reclassification  of  Drivers  as  employees,  workers  or  quasi-employees  where  those  statuses  exist,  have  and  could  lead  to  groups  of  Driversbecoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations.

If we are unable to compete effectively in theseindustries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete arehighly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States andCanada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriersto entry that characterize these industries. In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity toshift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and othermerchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume oforders; and shippers and carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused ona limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted mannerthan  we  do.  As  we  and  our  competitors  introduce  new  products  and  offerings,  and  as  existing  products  evolve,  we  expect  to  become  subject  to  additionalcompetition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, andcarriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate  our products. Increased competitioncould result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of ourplatform, and our margins.We face competition in each of our offerings, including:\u2022Mobility.  Our  Mobility  offering  competes  with  personal  vehicle  ownership  and  usage,  which  accounts  for  the  majority  of  passenger  miles  in  themarkets that we serve, and traditional transportation services, including taxicab companies and taxi-hailing services, livery and other car services. Inaddition, public transportation can be a superior substitute to our Mobility offering and in many cases, offers a faster and lower-cost travel option inmany cities. We also compete with other ridesharing companies, including certain of our minority-owned affiliates, for Drivers and riders, includingLyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt, and our Yandex.Taxi joint venture.\u2022Delivery.  Our Delivery  offering  competes  with  numerous  companies  in the  meal,  grocery  and  other  delivery  space  in various  regions  for  Drivers,consumers, and merchants, including DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Gopuff, Rappi, iFood, Delivery Hero, Just Eat Takeaway, and Amazon.Our  Delivery  offering  also  competes  with  restaurants,  including  those  that  offer  their  own  delivery  and/or  take-away,  meal  kit  delivery  services,grocery delivery services, and traditional grocers.\u2022Freight. Our  Freight  offering  competes  with  global  and  North  American  freight  brokers  such  as  C.H.

Further, in order to obtain regulatory approval of acquisitions, we may be required to divest all orpart of our or the target company\u2019s operations or agree to other remedies. Any such remedies could result in additional competition in some or all markets.For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors.

At times, in certain geographic markets,we have offered, and may continue to offer, Driver incentives that cause the total amount of the fare that a Driver retains, combined with the Driver incentives aDriver receives from us, to increase, at times meeting or exceeding the amount of Gross Bookings we generate for a given Trip. In certain geographic markets andregions, we do not have a leading category position, which may result in us choosing to further increase the amount of Driver incentives and consumer discountsand promotions that we offer in those geographic markets and regions. We cannot assure you that offering such Driver incentives and consumer discounts andpromotions will be successful. Driver incentives, consumer discounts, promotions, and reductions in fares and our service fee have negatively affected, and willcontinue to negatively affect, our financial performance.

We cannot assure you that our pricingmodels or strategies will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers.

Our  prior  failure  to  prioritize  compliance,  has  led  to  increased  regulatory  scrutinyglobally. Although we have since made changes in our company\u2019s cultural values and composition of our leadership team and have an ongoing commitment topromote  transparency  and  collaboration,  regulators  may  continue  to  perceive  us  negatively,  which  would  adversely  impact  our  business,  financial  condition,operating results, and prospects.Our historical workplace culture also created a lack of transparency internally, which resulted in siloed teams that lacked coordination and knowledge sharing,causing misalignment and inefficiencies in operational and strategic objectives. Although we have since embraced a culture of enhanced transparency, these effortsmay not be successful. Furthermore, many of our regional operations are not centrally managed, such that key policies may not be adequately communicated ormanaged to achieve consistent business objectives across functions and regions. Although we have reorganized some of our teams to address such issues, suchreorganizations may not be successful in aligning operational or strategic objectives across our company.Our workforce and operations have grown substantially since our inception and we have implemented several reductions in workforce in 2019 and 2020. If weare unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth or any reductions in workforce, our financial performance and futureprospects will be adversely affected.Since our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally.

We expect the total number of our employees located outside theUnited States to increase as we expand globally. Properly managing our growth will require us to continue to hire, train, and manage qualified employees and staff,including engineers, operations personnel, financial and accounting staff, and sales and marketing staff, and to improve and maintain our technology. If our newhires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing, and integrating new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining ourexisting employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in order to optimize our organizational structure, we have implemented several reductions inworkforce and restructurings, including in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business, and may in the future implement other reductionsin  workforce.  Any  reduction  in  workforce  or  restructuring  may  yield  unintended  consequences  and  costs,  such  as  attrition  beyond  the  intended  reduction  inworkforce, the distraction of employees, or reduced employee morale and could adversely affect our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficultfor  us  to  hire  new  employees  in  the  future  and  increase  the  risk  that  we  may  not  achieve  the  anticipated  benefits  from  the  reduction  in  workforce.

These fluctuations may be a result of a variety offactors, some of which are beyond our control, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results.For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, andtypically generate lower revenue in our third quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform during peak vacation season in certaincities, such as Paris. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility in the first quarter. In 2021, we experienced less seasonality as aresult of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which altered typical travel patterns. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in ourrevenue  in  the  first  and  fourth  quarters  compared  to  the  second  and  third  quarters,  although  the  historical  growth  of  Delivery  has  masked  these  seasonalfluctuations; however, in 2021, we experienced less seasonality as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, which accelerated the growth ofDelivery in 2021 as cities imposed dining restrictions and shelter in place orders. Our growth has made, and may in the future make, seasonal fluctuations difficultto  detect.  We  expect  these  seasonal  trends  to  become  more  pronounced  over  time  as  our  growth  slows.  Other  seasonal  trends  may  develop  or  these  existingseasonal trends may become more extreme, which would contribute to fluctuations in our operating results. In addition to seasonality, our operating results mayfluctuate as a result of factors including our ability to attract and retain new platform users, increased competition in the markets in which we operate, our ability toexpand our operations in new and existing markets, our ability to maintain an adequate growth rate and effectively manage that growth, our ability to keep pacewith  technological  changes  in  the  industries  in  which  we  operate,  changes  in  governmental  or  other  regulations  affecting  our  business,  harm  to  our  brand  orreputation, and other risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As such, we may not accurately forecast our operating results. We base ourexpense levels and investment plans on estimates, which has become more challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant portion of our expensesand investments are fixed, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, resulting in losses that exceed ourexpectations.

If our operations in largemetropolitan  areas  or  ability  to  provide  trips  to  and  from  airports  are  negatively  affected,  our  financial  results  and  future  prospects  would  be  adverselyimpacted.In 2021, we derived 23% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas\u2014Chicago, Miami, and New York City in the United States, Sao Pauloin Brazil, and London in the United Kingdom. We experience strong competition in large metropolitan areas, which has led us to offer significant Driver incentivesand  consumer  discounts  and  promotions  in  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  As  a  result  of  our  geographic  concentration,  our  business  and  financial  results  aresusceptible  to  economic,  social,  weather,  and  regulatory  conditions  or  other  circumstances  in  each  of  these  large  metropolitan  areas.  Outbreaks  of  contagiousdiseases or other viruses, such as COVID-19, could lead to a sustained decline in the desirability of living, working and congregating in metropolitan areas inwhich we operate. Any short-term or long-term shifts in the travel patterns of consumers away from metropolitan areas, due to health concerns regarding epidemicsor pandemics such as COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our Mobility Gross Bookings from these areas. An economic downturn, increased competition,or regulatory obstacles in any of these key metropolitan areas would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results to a much greaterdegree than would the occurrence of such events in other areas. In addition, any changes to local laws or regulations within these key metropolitan areas that affectour ability to operate or increase our operating expenses in these markets would have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, if we are unable to renewexisting  licenses  or  do  not  receive  new  licenses  in  key  metropolitan  areas  where  we  operate  or  such  licenses  are  terminated,  any  inability  to  operate  in  suchmetropolitan area, as well as the publicity concerning any such termination or non-renewal, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operatingresults.In addition, in August 2018, New York City approved regulations for the local for-hire market (which includes our ridesharing products), including a cap onthe  number  of  new  vehicle  licenses  issued  to  drivers  who  offer  for-hire  services.  In  December  2018,  New  York  City  implemented  a  per-mile  and  per-minuteminimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services in New York City, such as those provided byDrivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulations have had an adverse impact on our financialperformance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in November 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharingtrips in San Francisco was approved by voters in San Francisco. This surcharge took effect on January 1, 2020. In addition, other jurisdictions such as Seattle havepassed, or may consider or pass regulations that would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers to negotiate for minimum wages while providingservices on our platform. Further, we expect that we will continue to face challenges in penetrating lower-density suburban and rural areas, where our network issmaller and less liquid, the cost of personal vehicle ownership is lower, and personal vehicle ownership is more convenient.

Sustained declines in air travel  due to COVID-19, or other travel-related  health concerns,  could continue to suppress demand for airport-relatedMobility  and  reduce  our  Mobility  Gross  Bookings  from  airport  trips.  Certain  airports  currently  regulate  ridesharing  within  airport  boundaries,  including  bymandating  that  ridesharing  service  providers  obtain  airport-specific  licenses,  and  some  airports,  particularly  those  outside  the  United  States,  have  bannedridesharing operations altogether.

Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt ouroperations.  In  addition,  if  drop-offs  or  pick-ups  of  riders  become  inconvenient  because  of  airport  rules  or  regulations,  or  more  expensive  because  of  airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon hasacquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect thatthey  will  use  such  technology  to  further  compete  with  us  in  the  mobility,  delivery,  or  logistics  industries.  Waymo  has  already  introduced  a  commercializedridehailing fleet of autonomous vehicles, and it is possible that our competitors could introduce autonomous vehicle offerings earlier than we will be able to offerautonomous  vehicles  on  our  platform  through  our  commercial  agreement  with  Aurora  or  other  partners.  In  the  event  that  our  competitors  bring  autonomousvehicles to market before we are able to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to the technology of partieswith which we partner to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, whichwould adversely impact our financial performance and our prospects. For example, use of autonomous vehicles could substantially reduce the cost of providingridesharing, delivery, or logistics services, which could allow competitors to offer such services at a substantially lower price as compared to the price available toconsumers on our platform. If a significant  number of consumers choose to use our competitors\u2019 offerings over ours, our financial  performance and prospectswould be adversely impacted.Autonomous vehicle technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Collisions, including fatal collisions, have happened. Failures of autonomous vehicletechnologies that we may offer on our platform or crashes involving autonomous vehicles using the technology of our partners, could generate substantial liabilityfor us, create negative publicity about us, or result in regulatory scrutiny, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, prospects,and operating results.Federal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. Theseregulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented,we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or parties with which we partner tooffer autonomous vehicle technologies are unable to comply with existing or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous vehicles, we and our partners couldbecome subject to substantial fines or penalties.Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning couldadversely affect our business.Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in highdemand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors. Challenges related to our historical culture andworkplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees.Our employees have been working from home for almost two years in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and although we announced our \u201creturn to office\u201d plan,which includes shifting to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, we have not yet set a return-to-office-date in light of the dynamicnature of the pandemic.

Prolonged remotework, as well as COVID-19 more generally, introduced new dynamics into the households of many of our employees, including struggling with work-life balanceand  feelings  of  stress  and  social  isolation,  and  we  experienced  higher  levels  of  attrition.

Some of the factors that have an impact ondiscretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgagemarkets,  taxation,  energy  prices,  interest  rates,  consumer  confidence,  and  other  macroeconomic  factors.  Consumer  preferences  tend  to  shift  to  lower-costalternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to useone of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or publictransportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidityand may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results. Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of themerchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchasesfrom merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending atmany of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our productsand offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional oralternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.Factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  fuel  prices,  and  increased  vehicle  purchase,  rental,  or  maintenance  costs,  including  increased  prices  of  new  and  usedvehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, may increase the costs incurred by Drivers and carriers when providing services on our platform.Similarly,  factors  such  as  inflation,  increased  food  costs,  increased  labor  and  employee  benefit  costs,  increased  rental  costs,  and  increased  energy  costs  mayincrease merchant operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and carrier costs arebeyond the control of these parties. In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or toseek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likelycause order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause carriers to pass costs on to shippers, which may cause shipmentson our  platform  to  decline.  A  decreased  supply  of Drivers,  consumers,  merchants,  shippers,  or carriers  on our  platform  would  decrease  our  network  liquidity,which could harm our business and operating results.If we experience security or privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, disclosure of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietaryor confidential data, employee data, or platform user data, we may face loss of revenue, harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.We collect, use, and process a variety of personal data, such as email addresses, mobile phone numbers, profile photos, location information, drivers\u2019 licensenumbers and Social Security numbers of Drivers, consumer payment card information, and Driver and merchant bank account information.

Forexample, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatory authorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed accessto certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform, as of January 14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other datasecurity  breaches,  or  if  we  fail  to  remediate  this  or  any  other  data  security  breach  that  Careem  or  we  experience,  we  may  face  harm  to  our  brand,  businessdisruption, and significant liabilities.If we are unable to successfully introduce new or upgraded products, offerings, or features for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers, we mayfail to retain and attract such users to our platform and our operating results would be adversely affected.To continue to retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers to our platform, we will need to continue to invest in the developmentof new products, offerings, and features that add value for Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, and carriers and that differentiate us from our competitors. Forexample, in January 2020, we introduced a number of product changes in California intended to, among other things, provide Drivers with more information aboutrider destinations, trip distance, and expected fares, display prices more clearly, and allow users to select preferred Drivers, all of which are intended to furtherstrengthen the independence of Drivers in California and protect their ability to work flexibly when using the Uber platform.Developing and delivering these new or upgraded products, offerings, and features is costly, and the success of such new products, offerings, and featuresdepends on several factors, including the timely completion, introduction, and market acceptance of such products, offerings, and features. Moreover, any suchnew  or  upgraded  products,  offerings,  or  features  may  not  work  as  intended  or  may  not  provide  intended  value  to  platform  users.  For  example,  some  productchanges  in  California  have  resulted  in,  and  may  continue  to  result  in,  reduced  demand  for  rides  and  reduced  supply  of  Drivers  on  our  platform,  Driverdissatisfaction, and adverse impacts on the operation of our platform.

If we do not successfully manage those concerns, we could become subject to adverse regulatory actions and suffer reputational harm or otheradverse financial and accounting consequences.In certain jurisdictions, including India, Brazil, and Mexico, as well as certain other countries in Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we allowconsumers to use cash to pay Drivers the entire fare of rides and cost of meal deliveries (including our service fee from such rides and meal or grocery deliveries).In 2021, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 7% of our global27", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3476, "end_char_idx": 7144, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "92ccd675-2b2a-4629-81db-87d8a5aee1eb": {"__data__": {"id_": "92ccd675-2b2a-4629-81db-87d8a5aee1eb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3d36732c-31a4-4734-8b9f-78f80f54fcd0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "20571fbb0ae9d60d085bdad7e345ce8a01ea83fc46415901dfedd168d47f5490", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "7bd535cc-8370-410d-8b9c-e24bda60ee54", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "745db2d7246d104c23dffc05b95f5a36561812db6c93fedadc07ce7d57cb11b1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Gross\n Bookings.  This  percentage  may  increase  in  the  future,  particularly  in  the  markets  in  which  Careem  operates.  The  use  of  cash  in  connection  with  ourtechnology raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. For example, many jurisdictions have specific regulations regarding the use of cash forridesharing and certain jurisdictions prohibit the use of cash for ridesharing. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of significantfines and penalties and could result in a regulator requiring that we suspend operations in those jurisdictions. In addition to these regulatory concerns, the use ofcash with our Mobility products and Delivery offering can increase safety and security risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery, assault, violent orfatal attacks, and other criminal acts. In certain jurisdictions such as Brazil, serious safety incidents resulting in robberies and violent, fatal attacks on Drivers whileusing our platform have been reported. If we are not able to adequately address any of these concerns, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which couldadversely impact our business.In addition, establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure that we receive the correct service fee on cash trips is complex, and has in the past meant and maycontinue to mean that we cannot collect the entire service fee for certain of our cash-based trips. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit thecash received for cash-based trips and deliveries, as well as systems for us to collect, deposit, and properly account for the cash received, some of which are notalways effective, convenient, or widely-adopted by Drivers. Creating, maintaining, and improving these systems requires significant effort and resources, and wecannot guarantee these systems will be effective in collecting amounts due to us. Further, operating a business that uses cash raises compliance risks with respect toa variety of rules and regulations, including anti-money laundering laws. If Drivers fail to pay us under the terms of our agreements or if our collection systemsfail, we may be adversely affected by both the inability to collect amounts due and the cost of enforcing the terms of our contracts, including litigation. Suchcollection failure and enforcement costs, along with any costs associated with a failure to comply with applicable rules and regulations, could, in the aggregate,impact our financial performance.Loss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.In 2021, 74% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantlylimit our business model. We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry(\u201cPCI\u201d) and Data Security Standard (the \u201cStandard\u201d). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developedby the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures. Our failure to comply with the Standard and othernetwork operating  rules could result  in fines or restrictions  on our ability  to accept payment  cards. Under certain circumstances  specified in the payment cardnetwork rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities mayreveal  that  we  have  failed  to  comply  with  the  Standard.  If  an  audit,  self-  assessment,  or  other  test  determines  that  we  need  to  take  steps  to  remediate  anydeficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time consuming remediation efforts. In addition,even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach. Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt newoperating  rules  or  interpret  existing  rules  that  we  or  our  processors  might  find  difficult  or  even  impossible  to  follow,  or  costly  to  implement.  In  addition  toviolations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receiveincentives  from  them,  could  increase  our  costs,  or  could  otherwise  harm  our  business.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4567, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7bd535cc-8370-410d-8b9c-e24bda60ee54": {"__data__": {"id_": "7bd535cc-8370-410d-8b9c-e24bda60ee54", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3d36732c-31a4-4734-8b9f-78f80f54fcd0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "20571fbb0ae9d60d085bdad7e345ce8a01ea83fc46415901dfedd168d47f5490", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "92ccd675-2b2a-4629-81db-87d8a5aee1eb", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "30", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "30e48081b78c872676b043ae66a3203ab88fa1b36a925501bba1c824608f2d03", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "In addition,even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach.

From time to time, companies that use third-party open sourcesoftware have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license. We may besubject  to  suits  by  parties  claiming  ownership  of  what  we  believe  to  be  open  source  software,  or  claiming  non-compliance  with  the  applicable  open  sourcelicensing terms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open sourcesoftware to make available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code. While we employ practices designedto monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete opensource license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicableterms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number ofopen-source  software  license  types,  almost  none  of  which  have  been  tested  in  a  court  of  law,  resulting  in  a  dearth  of  guidance  regarding  the  proper  legalinterpretation of such licenses.

Furthermore, our futureincome taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated injurisdictions  that  have  higher  statutory  tax  rates,  changes  in  the  valuation  allowance  on  our  U.S.  and  Netherlands'  deferred  tax  assets,  or  changes  in  tax  laws,regulations, or accounting principles.

Any adverse outcome of such reviews and audits could have an adverse effect on our financialposition and operating results. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment byour management, and we have engaged in many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination remains uncertain. The ultimate tax outcome may differ fromthe amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made. Ourtax positions or tax returns are subject to change, and therefore we cannot accurately predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future,which  could  impact  our  financial  position.

Any subsequent integration or continued operation of such acquired businesses may result in an increased effective tax rate in certainjurisdictions or potential indirect tax costs, which could result in us incurring additional tax liabilities or having to establish a reserve in our consolidated financialstatements, and could adversely affect our financial results.Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.We are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions.

Inaddition, it remains unclear in some instances how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxableincome as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.We are unable to predict what global or U.S. tax reforms may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effects such future changes would have on ourbusiness. Any such changes in tax legislation, regulations, policies or practices in the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase the estimated tax liabilitythat we have expensed to date and paid or accrued on our balance sheet; affect our financial position, future operating results, cash flows, and effective tax rateswhere we have operations; reduce post-tax returns to our stockholders; and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.

Realization of these net operating losscarryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset futureincome  tax  liabilities,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.

In some cases, we have applied for and obtained licenses or permits to operate and must continue to comply with the license or permit requirementsor risk revocation. In addition, we may not be able to maintain or renew any such license or permit. For example, TfL scrutinizes our business in London on an on-going basis and we are subject to license reviews at renewal. In November 2019, TfL declined to issue us a license, finding that we were not \u201cfit and proper,\u201dincluding with respect to confidence in our change and release management processes. We successfully appealed and in September 2020, Westminster MagistratesCourt granted us an 18 month operating license on largely the same conditions as our previous license, finding us a fit and proper person. Two new conditions(which we volunteered) include providing to TfL consolidated monthly reporting in relation to regulatory obligations and maintaining our current processes. Anyinability  to  operate  in  markets  such  as  London,  as  well  as  publicity  concerning  adverse  judicial  or  licensing  decisions,  would  adversely  affect  our  business,revenue,  and  operating  results.  We  cannot  predict  whether  future  regulatory  decisions  or  legislation  in  other  jurisdictions  may  embolden  or  encourage  otherauthorities to take similar actions even where we are operating according to the terms of an existing license or permit. Additionally, since April 2019, MexicoCity\u2019s  Secretar\u00eda  de  Movilidad  passed  several  amendments  to  existing  ridesharing  regulations  implementing  certain  operational  requirements,  including  aprohibition  on  the  use  of  cash  to  pay  for  ridesharing  services  and,  effective  as  of  November  2019,  a  comprehensive  TNC  data  sharing  requirement  and  arequirement that Drivers in Mexico City obtain additional licenses and annual vehicle inspections to provide ridesharing services. Except for the vehicle inspection,we have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4636, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a841148-7cc9-4c18-ba40-ab45c2a09e73": {"__data__": {"id_": "4a841148-7cc9-4c18-ba40-ab45c2a09e73", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "e4910b2f-8cc6-4be1-8bd0-121212bcc444", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "d42bf542187b0d1e5d84a2362e91b93758fdbef6c037801e20ad4e12079c79d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ae984387-44c1-4b22-abe0-7261fd246a29", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "a8c4d8385dd00df37b6793572c7b11afb1c249a0a967b1bff6511b83f98bcdf3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Except for the vehicle inspection,we have an injunction against such operational requirements which, if implemented without modification, could have a negative impact on our business and ourfailure to comply with such regulations may result in a potential revocation of our license to operate in Mexico City.Traditional taxicab and car service operators in various jurisdictions continue to lobby legislators and regulators to block our Mobility products or to require usto comply with regulatory, insurance, record-keeping, licensing, and other requirements to which taxicab and car services are subject. For example, in January2019, we suspended our Mobility products in Barcelona after the regional government enacted regulations mandating minimum wait times before riders could bepicked up by ridesharing drivers; in March 2021, we returned to Barcelona via taxis only. In December 2018, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commissionimplemented a per-mile and per-minute minimum trip payment formula, designed to establish a minimum pay standard, for drivers providing for-hire services inNew York City, such as those provided by Drivers on our platform. These minimum rates took effect in February 2019. Since implementation, these regulationshave had an adverse impact on our financial performance in New York City and may continue to do so in the future. In August 2018, the New York City Councilvoted to approve various measures to further regulate our business, including driver earning rules, licensing requirements, and a one-year freeze on new for-hirevehicle licenses for ridesharing services like those enabled via our platform, while the city studies whether a permanent freeze would help reduce congestion. InAugust 2019, New York City\u2019s Taxi and Limousine Commission voted to extend such freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses and also voted to enact a new \u201ccruisingcap,\u201d intended to reduce the number of for-hire vehicles operating without passengers on platforms like ours in the central business district of New York City.Although such \u201ccruising cap\u201d was struck down by a New York state judge in December 2019, the freeze on for-hire vehicle licenses remains. Additionally, inNovember 2019, a ballot measure to impose a surcharge on ridesharing trips in San Francisco was passed by voters in San Francisco and such surcharge took effecton January 1, 2020. Also in January 2020, a new tax went into effect in Chicago that imposes a surcharge of up to $3 per ridesharing trip taken in Chicago. Inaddition, in October 2020, the Seattle City Council passed a minimum pay standard for drivers providing services on our platform that went into effect on January1, 2021, and other jurisdictions have in the past considered or may consider regulations which would implement minimum wage requirements or permit drivers tonegotiate for minimum wages while providing services on our platform.

In such jurisdictions, we may be subject to regulatory fines and proceedings and, in certain cases, may be required to ceaseoperations altogether if we continue to operate our business as currently conducted, unless and until such laws and regulations are reformed to clarify that ourbusiness operations are fully compliant. For example, in September 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal issued a ruling against a group of drivers whoused the Uber app, concluding that by driving for hire without a Hire Car Permit, they violated the local Road Traffic Ordinance. We are considering further legalchallenges and possible policy solutions. However, these developments may adversely affect our ability to offer ridesharing services and negatively impact ourfinancial performance in Hong Kong. As another example, in January 2020, we ceased offering our Mobility products in Colombia after a Colombian court ruledthat  we  violated  local  competition  laws.  In  response,  we  appealed  the  decision,  made  certain  changes  to  our  Mobility  products  in  Colombia  and  re-launchedMobility in Colombia in February 2020, and in June 2020, the Appeals Court of Bogota revoked its order to block Mobility products in Colombia. Furthermore, incertain of these jurisdictions, we continue to provide our products and offerings while we assess the applicability of these laws and regulations to our products andofferings or while we seek regulatory or policy changes to address concerns with respect to our ability to comply with these laws and regulations. Our decision tocontinue operating in these instances has come under investigation or has otherwise been subject to scrutiny by government authorities. Our continuation of thispractice and other past practices may result in fines or other penalties against us and Drivers imposed by local regulators, potentially increasing the risk that ourlicenses or permits that are necessary to operate in such jurisdictions will not be renewed. Such fines and penalties have in the past been, and may in the futurecontinue to be, imposed solely on Drivers, which may cause Drivers to stop providing services on our platform. In many instances, we make the business decisionas  a  gesture  of  goodwill  to  pay  the  fines  on  behalf  of  Drivers  or  to  pay  Drivers\u2019  defense  costs,  which,  in  the  aggregate,  can  be  in  the  millions  of  dollars.Furthermore, such business practices may also result in negative press coverage, which may discourage Drivers and consumers from using our platform and couldadversely affect our revenue. In addition, we face regulatory obstacles, including those lobbied for by our competitors or from local governments globally, thathave favored and may continue to favor local or incumbent competitors, including obstacles for potential Drivers seeking to obtain required licenses or vehiclecertifications. In addition, an increasing number of municipalities have proposed delivery network fee caps with respect to our Delivery offering and caps on surgepricing with respect to our Mobility offering. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant costs in defending our right to operate inaccordance with our business model in many jurisdictions. To the extent that efforts to block or limit our operations are successful, or we or Drivers are required tocomply with regulatory and other requirements applicable to taxicab and car services, our revenue and growth would be adversely affected.Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.As  of  December  31,  2021,  our  platform  is  available  in  approximately  10,500  cities  across  approximately  72  countries.

For example, as we expand our offerings in new areas, such as non-emergency  medicaltransportation, we may be subject to additional healthcare-related federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, because our offerings are frequently first-to-market in the jurisdictions in which we operate, several local jurisdictions have passed, and we expect additional jurisdictions to pass, laws and regulations thatlimit or block our ability  to offer  our products to Drivers and consumers  in those jurisdictions,  thereby impeding overall  use of our platform. We are activelychallenging  some  of  these  laws  and  regulations  and  are  lobbying  other  jurisdictions  to  oppose  similar  restrictions  on  our  business,  especially  our  ridesharingservices. Further, because a substantial portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, laws, regulations, or governmental actions seeking to curbair pollution or emissions may impact our business. For example, in response to London\u2019s efforts to cut emissions and improve air quality in the city (including theinstitution of a toxicity charge for polluting vehicles in the city center congestion zone and the introduction of an \u201cUltra Low Emissions Zone\u201d that went into effectin April 2019), we have added a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile to each trip on our platform in London, and plan to help Drivers on our platform fully transitionto electric vehicles by 2025.

We initiated some of these legal challenges to contestthe application of certain laws and regulations to our business. Others have been brought by taxicab owners, local regulators, local law enforcement, and platformusers, including Drivers and consumers. These include individual, multiple plaintiff, and putative class and class action claims for alleged violation of laws relatedto,  among  other  things,  transportation,  competition,  advertising,  consumer  protection,  fee  calculations,  personal  injuries,  privacy,  intellectual  property,  productliability, discrimination, safety, and employment. For example, in May 2019, a class action was filed against us and certain of our subsidiaries in the SupremeCourt of Victoria, Australia on behalf of participants in the taxi, hire-car, limousine, and charter vehicle industry who were licensed to operate in particular regionsof Australia during certain periods between April 2014 and August 2017. The class action alleges that we operated unlawfully in such regions during such periods.These legislative and regulatory proceedings, allegations, and lawsuits are expensive and time consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result infinancial damages or penalties, including criminal penalties, incarceration, and sanctions for individuals employed by us or parties with whom we contract, whichcould harm our ability  to operate  our business as planned in one or more of the jurisdictions  in which we operate,  which could adversely  affect  our business,revenue, and operating results.In addition, while we divested certain assets of our dockless e-bikes and e-scooters business to Lime in May 2020, consumers continue to have access todockless e-bikes and e-scooters through our app. We expect dockless e-bikes and e-scooters to subject us to additional risks distinct from those relating to our otherMobility, Delivery and Freight offerings. For example, consumers using dockless e-bikes or e-scooters face a more severe level of injury in the event of a collisionthan that faced while riding in a vehicle, given the less sophisticated, and in some cases absent, passive protection systems on dockless e-bikes and e-scooters. Theoccurrence of real or perceived quality problems or material defects in current or future dockless e-bikes or e-scooters available via our app could result in negativepublicity, market withdrawals, regulatory proceedings, enforcement actions, or lawsuits filed against us, particularly if consumers are injured.Changes in, or failure to comply with, competition laws could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Competition  authorities  closely  scrutinize  us  under  U.S.  and  foreign  antitrust  and  competition  laws.  An  increasing  number  of  governments  are  enforcingcompetition laws and are doing so with increased scrutiny, including governments in large markets such as the EU, the United States, Brazil, and India, particularlysurrounding issues of predatory pricing, price-fixing, and abuse of market power. Many of these jurisdictions also allow competitors or consumers to assert claimsof anti-competitive conduct. For example, complaints have been filed in several jurisdictions, including in the United States and India, alleging that our prices aretoo high (surge pricing) or too low (discounts or predatory pricing), or both. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions onour  business,  other  jurisdictions  may  follow.  Further,  any  new  requirements  or  restrictions,  or  proposed  requirements  or  restrictions,  could  result  in  adversepublicity or fines, whether or not valid or subject to appeal.In  addition,  governmental  agencies  and  regulators  may,  among  other  things,  prohibit  future  acquisitions,  divestitures,  or  combinations  we  plan  to  make,impose  significant  fines  or penalties,  require  divestiture  of  certain  of our  assets,  or impose  other  restrictions  that  limit  or require  us to modify  our operations,including limitations on our contractual relationships with platform users or restrictions on our pricing models.

In some countries, it is not clear whether we are required to be licensed asa  payment  services  provider.  Were  local  regulators  to  determine  that  such  arrangements  require  us  to  be  so  licensed,  such  regulators  may  block  payments  toDrivers, merchants, shippers or carriers. Such regulatory actions, or the need to obtain regulatory approvals, could impose significant costs and involve substantialdelay in payments we make in certain local markets, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operating results.Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject toStrong Customer Authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticateeach payment transaction. These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make ourplatform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use ourplatform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results,and  prospects.  Further,  as  a  result  of  implementing  SCA,  many  payment  transactions  on  our  platform  may  fail  to  be  authenticated  due  to  platform  users  notcompleting  all  necessary  authentication  steps.  Thus,  in  some  cases,  we  may  not  receive  payment  from  consumers  in  advance  of  paying  Drivers  for  servicesreceived  by  those  users.

Failure  to comply with these and other orders could result  in substantial  fines,enforcement  actions,  injunctive  relief,  and  other  penalties  that  may  be  costly  or  that  may  impact  our  business.  We  may  also  assume  liabilities  for  breachesexperienced by the companies we acquire as we expand our operations. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed and notified relevant regulatoryauthorities that it had been subject to a data security breach that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform as of January14, 2018. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breachthat Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities. Our insurance programs may not cover all potentialclaims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities.This  risk  is  enhanced  in  certain  jurisdictions  with  stringent  privacy  laws  and,  as  we  expand  our  products,  offerings,  and  operations  domestically  andinternationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacyand security.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4789, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0ff8bce1-62c6-4bf5-a4cf-6c135c8c9399": {"__data__": {"id_": "0ff8bce1-62c6-4bf5-a4cf-6c135c8c9399", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1679d9f9-7468-41cc-b550-277b08220145", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "6e5c3a7c9064e7142ea34eacde3a9ee3caaffce02677fb3ee30f95a6e39f8e3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "90075ad1-8756-4c15-9306-fbd131a27a50", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "9a8dc849c586f1c15c782fe3f1fbf8429b9356dc2b25d59fad54bb2a8188bbd2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security breaches or if we fail to remediate this or any other data security breachthat Careem or we experience, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements forcontrollers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include higher consent standards to process personal data, robust disclosures regarding the use ofpersonal  data,  strengthened  individual  data  rights,  data  breach  requirements,  limitations  on  data  retention,  strengthened  requirements  for  special  categories  ofpersonal  data  and  pseudonymised  (i.e.,  key-coded)  data,  and  additional  obligations  for  contracting  with  service  providers  that  may  process  personal  data.  TheGDPR  further  provides  that  EU  member  states  may  institute  additional  laws  and  regulations  impacting  the  processing  of  personal  data,  including  (i)  specialcategories of personal data (e.g., racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or philosophical beliefs) and (ii) profiling of individuals and automatedindividual decision-making. Such additional laws and regulations could limit our ability to use and share personal or other data, thereby increasing our costs andharming our business and financial condition. Non-compliance with the GDPR (including any non-compliance by any acquired business) is subject to significantpenalties, including fines of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Otherjurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, which will increase our compliance costsand the risks associated with non-compliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which provides new privacy rights for consumers andnew operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of actionagainst businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Other U.S.states  have  adopted,  and  likely  will  continue  to  adopt,  similar  laws  that  provide  new  consumer  privacy  rights  and  business  operational  requirements.  Brazilprovides another example, having passed the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados Pessoais, or LGPD) in 2018, which is now in effect.These laws may be subject to amendments and regulations that may change over time, or result in additional follow-on laws such as the California Privacy RightsAct (\u201cCPRA\u201d)39", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4008, "end_char_idx": 7405, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0f3f74b6-817b-40db-ae06-69c833351447": {"__data__": {"id_": "0f3f74b6-817b-40db-ae06-69c833351447", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1feb6e66-d58a-42e6-9ba7-fb15b7393cb2", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "42", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "5c04bdfc2497852341543e96e98b673684ef09e219a90618741b524343637f3f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "4bc09ef6-6471-492e-b79a-f62078f57e36", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "dc92b6523ad1af0ec4b14fd482d0d38c6fefa902ea75cfe4af086ca7a87b739a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "passed in California in Novembe\nr 2020.Additionally, we are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to transfer of personaldata outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, including the EU Standard Contract Clauses. Such mechanisms have receivedheightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny and are undergoing modifications, and a 2020 decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union casts doubt on theadequacy of all of the formerly-approved mechanisms for transferring personal data from countries in the EEA to certain other countries such as the United States.If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transferpersonal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, including from state and city regulators as a requirementfor  obtaining  or  maintaining  a  license  or  otherwise,  from  law  enforcement  agencies,  and  from  intelligence  agencies.  This  disclosure  may  result  in  a  failure  orperceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, and regulations, could result in proceedings or actions against us inthe same or other jurisdictions, and could have an adverse impact on our reputation and brand. In addition, Careem has historically shared certain user data withcertain government authorities, which conflicts with our global policies regarding data use, sharing, and ownership. We expect to maintain our data use, sharing,and ownership practices for both our business and Careem\u2019s business, and doing so may cause our relationship with government authorities in certain jurisdictionsto  suffer,  and  may  result  in  such  government  authorities  assessing  significant  fines  or  penalties  against  us  or  shutting  down  our  or  Careem\u2019s  app  on  either  atemporary or indefinite basis. Further, if any jurisdiction in which we operate changes its laws, rules, or regulations relating to data residency or local computationsuch that we are unable to comply in a timely manner or at all, we may risk losing our rights to operate in such jurisdictions. This could adversely affect the mannerin which we provide our products and offerings and thus materially affect our operations and financial results.Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thuscompliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer,disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs. Additionally, any failure or perceivedfailure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us byindividuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, iffound liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity.If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit ourability to operate our business.We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legalproceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, shippers, carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others.

These  provisions  are  intended  to  streamline  the  litigationprocess for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration maybecome more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certainrisks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may inthe future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increaseour  litigation  costs  and  exposure  in  respect  of  such  proceedings.  For  example,  effective  May  15,  2018,  we  ended  mandatory  arbitration  of  sexual  misconductclaims by platform users and employees.Further,  with  the  potential  for  conflicting  rules  regarding  the  scope  and  enforceability  of  arbitration  on  a  state-by-state  basis,  as  well  as  conflicting  rulesbetween state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories ofprotection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, wecould experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costlylawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.40", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4201, "end_char_idx": 7018, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5835acdc-0981-4400-a6f6-618aff172c15": {"__data__": {"id_": "5835acdc-0981-4400-a6f6-618aff172c15", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "913dd864-abc4-4248-a5d9-abd6b1e82294", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "43", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "aff64b0bbd8162bc8d06c1e208db1e5fd3a2e30b4529c6b3b305d8c210e79f22", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "3b737274-7c58-4d8e-92c2-5164ecf0bdf2", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "f196764ee113560a3f128cc6af70435cf4023922a9df22aebf9141114b7622d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We\n have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries,investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.We have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption.

We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers. We rely on alimited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannotguarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain otherautomobile  insurance  coverage  for  owned  vehicles  and  employee  activity,  as  well  as  insurance  coverage  for  non-automotive  corporate  risks  including  generalliability, workers\u2019 compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers\u2019 liability. If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a mannerunfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States andCanada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significantadditional costs.In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that41", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3798, "end_char_idx": 6912, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03082e14-4ec0-48d1-a800-a3b4d071bb6e": {"__data__": {"id_": "03082e14-4ec0-48d1-a800-a3b4d071bb6e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d5a81b01-ca92-4768-8328-6a238a907fc1", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "44", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "8720d8469e0ab1b6ada042d8c2333bba8d15fd08fd567fdcc6f5478c3f9e9f9e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9f9957c2-e494-438c-b3b4-61f474ba68c0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "0ccfec8f9cb8b017023a306c5f10a33b857cfa2dfaa7664cb064e333ca9e235e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "transfer\n a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amountsthat may be in excess of our insurance reserves, resulting in harm to our financial condition.

Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates,historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of ourreserves. We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have asignificant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers whouse  our  platform,  even  when  those  Drivers  are  not  actively  using  our  platform  or  when  an  individual  impersonates  a  Driver.  As  we  expand  to  include  moreofferings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight. As a result, our automobile liability and generalliability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that areclaimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims donot  result  in  liability,  we  could  incur  significant  costs  in  investigating  and  defending  against  them.

Legislation  has  been  passed  in  many  U.S.  jurisdictions  that  codifies  these  insurance  requirements  with  respect  to  ridesharing.Additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions that seeks to codify or change insurance requirements with respect to ridesharing. Further, serviceproviders and business customers of Freight and Uber for Business may require higher levels of coverage as a condition to entering into certain key contracts withus. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with local laws, rules, and regulations or contractual obligations relating to insurance coverage could result inproceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. These lawsuits, proceedings, or actions may subject us to significant penalties and negativepublicity, require us to increase our insurance coverage, require us to amend our insurance policy disclosure, increase our costs, and disrupt our business.We may be subject to pricing regulations, as well as related litigation or regulatory inquiries.Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. Our pricing models, including dynamic pricing, havebeen, and will likely continue to be, challenged, banned, limited in emergencies, and capped in certain jurisdictions. For example, we have agreed to not calculateconsumer fares in excess of the maximum government-mandated fares in all major Indian cities where legal proceedings have limited the use of surge pricing.Further, in 2018, Honolulu, Hawaii became the first U.S. city to pass legislation to cap surge pricing if increased rates exceed the maximum fare set by the city.Additional regulation of our pricing models could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, our pricing model has been thesubject  of  litigation  and  regulatory  inquiries  related  to,  among  other  things,  the  calculation  of  and  statements  regarding  consumer  fares  and  Driver  earnings(including rates, fees, surcharges, and tolls), as well as the use of surge pricing during emergencies and natural disasters.

To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to therequirements of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectivenessof  our  internal  control  over  financial  annually.  We  currently  are  required  to  disclose  changes  in  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  that  have  materiallyaffected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly andchallenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in sizeand complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline requiredfor a public company. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control overfinancial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, particularly due to high growthofferings (such as with Delivery and Freight), which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintaininternal  control  over  financial  reporting  could  severely  inhibit  our  ability  to  accurately  report  our  financial  condition  or  operating  results.  If  we  are  unable  toconclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a materialweakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the marketprice of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SECor other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these andother effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.ITEM 1B.

The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during theperiod 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. Theclaim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value ofcertain taxi licenses.

We denythese allegations and intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.Other Legal ProceedingsWhile  it  is  not  possible  to  determine  the  outcome  of  the  legal  actions,  investigations,  and  proceedings  brought  against  us,  we  believe  that,  except  for  thematters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could bematerial  to  our  consolidated  results  of  operations  in  any  one  accounting  period.

This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the UnitedStates where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and governmentinvestigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, andgovernment investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorablepreliminary and interim rulings.ITEM 4.

The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  rapidlychanged market and economic conditions globally, impacting Drivers, Merchants, consumers and business partners, as well as our business, results of operations,financial  position,  and  cash  flows.  Various  governmental  restrictions,  including  the  declaration  of  a  federal  National  Emergency,  multiple  cities\u2019  and  states\u2019declarations of states of emergency, school and business closings, quarantines, restrictions on travel, limitations on social or public gatherings, and other measureshave, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the global demand for Mobility rides.Furthermore, we are experiencing and expect to continue to experience Driver supply constraints, and such supply constraints have been and may continue to beimpacted by concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.COVID-19 Response InitiativesWe continue to prioritize the health and safety of our consumers, Drivers and Merchants, our employees and the communities we serve and continue to believewe will play an important role in the economic recovery of cities around the globe. We are focused on navigating the challenges presented by COVID-19 throughpreserving our liquidity and managing our cash flow by taking preemptive action to enhance our ability to meet our short-term liquidity needs. The pandemic hasreduced the demand for our Mobility offering globally, while accelerating the growth of our Delivery offerings. We have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic bylaunching new, or expanding existing, services or features on an expedited basis, particularly those related to delivery of food and other goods.To comply with social distancing guidelines of national, state and local governments, we have temporarily suspended our shared rides Mobility offering inmost markets, and implemented \u201cleave at door\u201d delivery options for Delivery offerings. Additionally, we have asked that all employees who are able to do so, towork remotely.As  vaccination  rates  increase  in  the  United  States,  we  are  observing  that  consumer  demand  for  Mobility  is  recovering  faster  than  driver  availability,  andconsumer demand for Delivery continues to exceed Courier availability. During the first half of 2021, we announced that we are increasing investments in driverincentives to improve driver availability in the near-term.While we continue to assess the impact from the COVID-19 outbreak, we are unable to accurately  predict the full impact of COVID-19 on our business,results of operations, financial position, and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, any futurewaves or resurgences of the virus, variants of the virus, the administration, adoption and efficacy of vaccines in the United States and internationally, additionalactions  that  may  be  taken  by  governmental  authorities,  the  further  impact  on  the  business  of  Drivers,  Merchants,  consumers,  and  business  partners,  and  otherfactors identified in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Driver Classification DevelopmentsThe  classification  of  Drivers  is  currently  being  challenged  in  courts,  by  legislators  and  by  government  agencies  in  the  United  States  and  abroad.  We  areinvolved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims beforeadministrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or asworkers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5,2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San FranciscoSuperior Court (the \u201cCourt\u201d) against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the allegedcompetitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order prohibiting us from classifying Drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws. Following a stay of the injunction and our unsuccessful appeal of the injunction to a Court of Appeal, we were ordered to comply withthe preliminary injunction.

In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that useplatforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General\u2019spreliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods before the effective date ofProposition 22.In January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional,which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the court ruled thatProposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and theProtect App-Based Drivers and Services has also filed an appeal.To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earningsfloor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care.

The tribunal ruled on October 28, 2016 that the Drivers were workers whenever our appwas switched on and they were ready and able to take trips, based on an assessment of the app in July 2016. The Court of Appeal rejected our appeal in a majoritydecision on December 19, 2018. We appealed to the Supreme Court and a hearing at the Supreme Court took place in July 2020.On  February  19,  2021,  the  Supreme  Court  of  the  UK upheld  the  tribunal  ruling.  Subsequently,  we  initiated  a  historical  claims  settlement  process  for  UKdrivers. Damages may include back pay including holiday pay and minimum wage. Additional claimants have also filed and each claimant will be required to bringtheir own separate action to an employment tribunal to determine whether they met the \u201cworker\u201d classification and if so, how much each claimant will be awarded.On March 16, 2021, we announced that more than 70,000 drivers in the UK will be treated as workers, earning at least the National Living Wage when drivingwith Uber. They will also be paid for holiday time and all those eligible will be automatically enrolled into a pension plan. We have also completed a settlementprocess with drivers in the UK to proactively resolve historical claims relating to their classification under UK law.On June 23, 2021, we received a compliance notice from the UK pension regulator to facilitate our auto-enrollment implementation. The pension regulator hasconfirmed  that  Uber  will  be  required  to  pay  historic  company  contributions,  but  that  we  are  not  required  to  pay  the  driver  component  of  historic  pensioncontributions  unless  we  fail  to  comply  in  which  case  the  amount  equivalent  to  those  contributions  would  be  payable  as  a  penalty.

Compensation hearings willtake place in 2022 for claimants who have not settled their historic claims, where the tribunal will assess our position on the correct approach to working time.In September 2021, a Netherlands court ruled that Mobility drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, wewould  incur  significant  additional  expenses  for  compensating  Drivers,  including  expenses  associated  with  the  application  of  wage  and  hour  laws  (includingminimum  wage,  overtime,  and  meal  and  rest  period  requirements),  employee  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  taxes  (direct  and  indirect),  and  potentialpenalties.

The increase inGross Bookings was primarily driven by an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 71%, or 66% on a constant currency basis, due to an increase in food deliveryorders  and  higher  basket  sizes  as  a  result  of  stay-at-home  order  demand  related  to  COVID-19,  as  well  as  continued  expansion  across  U.S.  and  internationalmarkets. The increase was also driven by Mobility Gross Bookings growth of 38%, or 36% on a constant currency basis, due to increases in Trip volumes as thebusiness recovers from the impacts of COVID-19.

We also exited the JUMP business and incurred costsrelated to site closures, asset impairments and write-offs. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $362 million in total restructuringand related charges in the consolidated statement of operations. Total restructuring and related charges included $248 million of cash settled charges, primarily forseverance and other termination benefits. The remaining costs related to these restructuring activities are expected to be immaterial.These  activities  were  designed  to  generate  an  aggregate  cost  savings  of  at  least  $1.0  billion  annually  when  compared  to  our  original  fourth  quarter  2020planned cost structure, with the largest component of savings resulting from reductions in workforce. We do not believe these cost-saving measures will impair ourability to conduct any of our key business functions. As of December 31, 2021, we achieved these aggregate cost savings when compared to our original fourthquarter 2020 planned cost structure.

Mobility Take Rate was 19.0%, down from 22.9% compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in Mobility Driverincentives, as Mobility Driver additions have been outpaced by higher demand recovery in the U.S. and other markets.Mobility  adjusted  EBITDA  profit  increased  primarily  attributable  to  an  increase  in  Mobility  revenue,  partially  offset  by  variable  costs  attributable  to  theoverall growth of the business.Delivery SegmentFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Delivery revenue increased $4.5 billion, or 114% and Delivery adjustedEBITDA loss improved $525 million, or 60%.Delivery revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 66%, on a constant currency basis, driven by an increase infood  delivery  orders  and  higher  basket  sizes  as  a  result  of  stay-at-home  demand  related  to  COVID-19,  combined  with  continued  expansion  across  U.S.  andinternational markets. Take Rate improved to 16.2% from 12.9% compared to the same period in 2020 driven by a decrease in incentive spend combined with anoverall improvement in basket sizes. Additionally, we saw an increase in Delivery revenue and Take Rate resulting from an increase in certain Courier paymentsand incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, where we are primarily responsible for delivery services and pay Couriers for services provided.Delivery  adjusted  EBITDA  loss  improved,  primarily  attributable  to  an  increase  in  Delivery  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  $2.6  billion  increase  in  cost  ofrevenue as well as a $710 million increase in consumer promotions, brand marketing, and employee headcount costs.Freight SegmentFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, Freight revenue increased $1.1 billion, or 111% and Freight adjustedEBITDA loss improved $97 million, or 43%.Freight revenue increased primarily attributable  to the acquisition of Transplace in the fourth quarter of 2021. Additionally, the increase in Freight revenue isalso driven by the growth in the number of shippers and carriers on the network combined with an increase in volumes with our top shippers.Freight adjusted EBITDA loss improved, primarily attributable to a $135 million improvement in gross profit as a result of increased load margins, partiallyoffset by an increase in employee headcount costs.(1)\n(2), (3) (4)(1)(2)(3) (4)59", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4249, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5271f8a7-6fa9-4566-8e7e-9703a7e35b50": {"__data__": {"id_": "5271f8a7-6fa9-4566-8e7e-9703a7e35b50", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "153aa2b2-b244-4893-bedf-6f04400ac277", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "62", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "71ba2f44f1a34c0b39714d10cbb66e1831259bb53a87b8b2140e6ef5719b2b5e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "All Other\nFor  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020,  All  Other  revenue  decreased  $127  million,  or  94%  and  All  Otheradjusted EBITDA loss improved $450 million, or 98%.All Other revenue and All Other adjusted EBITDA loss improved primarily due to the  favorable impact of the sale of our ATG Business in the first quarter of2021 and the JUMP Divestiture in the second quarter of 2020.Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA and revenue  growth rates in constant currency  are non-GAAP financial  measures.

MAPCs  is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility or New Mobility ride or received a Deliveryorder on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on ourplatform  in  a  given  month,  that  unique  consumer  is  counted  as  only  one  MAPC.  We  use  MAPCs  to  assess  the  adoption  of  our  platform  and  frequency  oftransactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.\nTrips. We  define  Trips  as  the  number  of  completed  consumer  Mobility  or  New  Mobility  rides  and  Delivery  orders  in  a  given  period.  For  example,  anUberPOOL ride with three paying consumers represents three unique Trips, whereas an UberX ride with three passengers represents one Trip. We believe thatTrips are a useful metric to measure the scale and usage of our platform.\n60", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1840, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "084da1a6-38f8-48e7-a091-2c48defe3b4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "084da1a6-38f8-48e7-a091-2c48defe3b4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "77c3aad0-157b-4864-a5bf-bb1555317770", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "63", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "7f2973ff8f9382d87724f6682299d5b3c724758e29f2e23bdf6a0743d844d1e3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Gross\n Bookings.

The decrease in cash consumed by working capital and other operating activities was primarily drivenby an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, an increase in our insurance reserves, partially offset by higher accounts receivable and prepaid expensesand lower operating lease liabilities.

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires judgment on a significant accountingestimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could havebeen  used,  or  changes  in  the  accounting  estimates  that  are  reasonably  likely  to  occur  periodically,  could  materially  impact  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures in our audited consolidated financial statements. We have based our estimates on historical experience andon  various  other  assumptions  that  are  believed  to  be  reasonable  under  the  circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  thecarrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Although we believe that the estimates we use are reasonable, due to theinherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results reported in future periods could differ from those estimates.64", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3500, "end_char_idx": 6038, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "e1f5f20d-6037-40f6-b65e-c970ae8c4bbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "e1f5f20d-6037-40f6-b65e-c970ae8c4bbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "54544818-dc4f-4fe7-91b2-ed9edb8a8396", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "67", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "d4c62d503130a8817fd08311ee35e8501614cc4f2ca419ca9b107666fab74c7b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "08dbf32e-22fa-4f6c-bc90-f7c92c3616fa", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "9ac34fca460a12efcb55a7dc14c6d608c9dca5b21bb4760a6b055ee0067aa965", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "We\n believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of ourconsolidated  financial  statements.  For  additional  information,  see  the  disclosure  included  in  Note  1  \u2013  Description  of  Business  and  Summary  of  SignificantAccounting  Policies  in  the  notes  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Part  II,  Item  8,  \u201cFinancial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data,\u201d  of  thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue principally from service fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for the use of our platform in connection with our Mobility products andDelivery offering provided by Drivers and Merchants to end-users. Our sole performance obligation in the transaction is to connect Drivers and Merchants withend-users to facilitate the completion of a successful ridesharing trip or delivery. Because end-users access our platform for free, except in certain markets, and wehave no performance obligation to end-users, end-users are not our customers.Judgment is required in evaluating the presentation of revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-userand are the principal in the transaction (gross), or we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user and are the agent in the transaction (net). Wehave concluded that we are the agent in most markets as we arrange for Drivers and Merchants to provide the service to the end user in Mobility and Deliverytransactions.  The  assessment  of  whether  we  are  considered  the  principal  or  the  agent  in  a  transaction  could  impact  the  accounting  for  certain  payments  andincentives provided to Drivers and end-users and change the timing and amount of revenue recognized.In certain markets, consumers have the option to pay Drivers cash for trips, and we generally collect our service fee from Drivers for these trips by offsettingagainst any other amounts due to Drivers, including Driver incentives. We have concluded collectability of such amounts is not probable until collected. As such,uncollected service fees for cash trips are not recognized as revenue in our consolidated financial statements until collected.Driver IncentivesWe offer various incentive programs to Drivers. Judgment is required to determine the appropriate classification of these incentives. Incentives provided tocustomers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct service in exchange or cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the servicereceived. Incentives offered in exchange for specific services, such as referral services are recorded as sales and marketing expenses.End-User Discounts and PromotionsWe offer discounts and promotions to end-users (that are not customers) to encourage use of our platform. Judgment is required to determine the appropriateclassification of these incentives. End-user discounts and promotions are recorded to sales and marketing expenses with the exception of market-wide promotionswhich are recorded as a reduction of revenue.Business CombinationsWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimatedfair values. The excess of the fair  value of purchase  consideration  over the fair values of these identifiable  assets and liabilities  is recorded as goodwill. Suchvaluations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.

Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are initially recorded at cost andare subsequently adjusted to fair value for impairments and price changes from observable transactions in the same or a similar security from the same issuer.Investments in material available-for-sale debt securities are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date withthe changes in fair value recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We may elect the fair value option for financial instruments and account forinvestments in debt and equity securities at fair value with changes reported in net income (loss) from continuing operations.Investments in privately held equity and debt securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs or data in inactive markets. This valuation requiresjudgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent lack of liquidity and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. In determining the estimatedfair  value  of  our  investments  in  privately  held  companies,  we  utilize  the  most  recent  data  available  including  observed  transactions  such  as  equity  financingtransactions of the investees and sales of the existing shares of the investees\u2019 securities. In addition, the determination of whether an observed transaction is similarto the equity and debt securities held by us requires significant management judgment based on the rights and preferences of the securities.We assess our investment portfolio of privately held equity and debt securities quarterly for impairment. The impairment analysis for investments in equitysecurities includes a qualitative analysis of factors including the investee\u2019s financial performance, industry and market conditions, and other relevant factors. If anequity  investment  is  considered  to  be  impaired  we  will  establish  a  new  carrying  value  for  the  investment  and  recognize  an  impairment  loss  through  ourconsolidated statement of operations. Investments in debt securities are evaluated for impairment quarterly based on whether its fair value has declined below itsamortized cost. In circumstances where we intend to sell, or are more likely than not required to sell the security before it recovers its amortized cost basis, thedifference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized as a loss in the consolidated financial statement of operations, with a corresponding write-downof the security\u2019s amortized cost. In circumstances where neither condition exists, we then evaluate whether a decline is due to credit-related factors. The factorsconsidered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost basis, changes in the credit qualityof the underlying loan obligors, credit ratings actions, as well as other factors. To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we comparethe present value of the expected cash flows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balancesheet with a corresponding adjustment to net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensiveincome (loss), net of tax. Improvements in expected cash flows due to improvements in credit are recognized through reversal of the credit loss and correspondingreduction in the allowance for credit loss.Equity Method InvestmentsWe account for investments in the common stock or in-substance common stock of entities that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence,but not a controlling financial interest, using the equity method.

We make certain judgments and assumptions to determine our reporting units and in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carryingvalues for each of our reporting units. Determination of reporting units is based on a judgmental evaluation of the level at which our segment managers reviewfinancial results, evaluate performance, and allocate resources.Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include, among other factors: financial performance; legal, regulatory, contractual, political,business, and other factors; entity specific factors; industry and market considerations, macroeconomic conditions, and other relevant events and factors affectingthe reporting unit.

We regularlyassess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.67", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3922, "end_char_idx": 6095, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "228c8e2e-f5ff-440f-8464-c52d379e6285": {"__data__": {"id_": "228c8e2e-f5ff-440f-8464-c52d379e6285", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5a1fdbf3-7dc2-4a02-9093-082b3cda3198", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "70", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "2d873caf4bd34373c89fd44311a0526c1ea16198abdb83ae1990c5afe5452b07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "76d839e8-129b-4ff5-aa29-685095889aa5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "158ff40a6528a1972230f43494adc7b2d86a23bdf63e8a52286a6dbfd1f5307c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Insurance Reserves\nWe  use a combination  of third-party  insurance  and self-insurance  mechanisms,  including  a wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary,  to provide  for  thepotential  liabilities  for  certain  risks,  including  auto  liability,  uninsured  and  underinsured  motorist,  auto  physical  damage,  general  liability,  and  workers\u2019compensation. The insurance reserves is an estimate of our potential liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which represents the estimate of theultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by us and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amount for losses incurred but notreported as of the balance sheet date. The estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation utilizes generally accepted actuarial methods applied to historical claim andloss  experience.  In  addition,  we  use  assumptions  based  on  actuarial  judgment  related  to  claim  and  loss  development  patterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  whichconsider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.  These  reserves  are  continually  reviewed  and  adjusted  as  experience  develops  and  newinformation becomes known. Adjustments, if any, relating to accidents that occurred in prior years are reflected in the current year results of operations.All estimates of ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses, and of resulting reserves, are subject to inherent variability caused by the nature of theinsurance claim settlement process. Such variability is increased for us due to limited historical experience and the nature of the coverage provided. Actual resultsdepend upon the outcome of future contingent events and can be affected by many factors, such as claim settlement processes and changes in the economic, legal,and social environments. As a result, the net amounts that will ultimately be paid to settle the liability, and when these amounts will be paid, may vary in the nearterm from the estimated amounts.While management believes that the insurance reserve amount is adequate, the ultimate liability may be in excess of, or less than, the amount provided.Stock-Based CompensationWe have granted stock-based awards consisting primarily of stock options, restricted common stock, RSUs, warrants, and SARs to employees, members ofour board of directors and non-employees. The substantial majority of our stock-based awards have been made to employees. The majority of our outstandingRSUs, as well as certain options, SARs, and shares of restricted common stock, contain a service-based vesting condition. A small portion of the awards containsservice-based vesting condition as well as performance-based vesting condition and/or market-based vesting condition. The service-based vesting condition for themajority of these awards is satisfied over four years. The performance-based vesting condition is satisfied upon meeting predetermined targets of certain financialand operation metrics. The market-based vesting condition is satisfied upon reaching predetermined targets of fully diluted equity values.We account for stock-based employee compensation under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions, in accordance with applicable accountingstandards, which requires compensation expense for the grant-date fair value of stock-based awards to be recognized over the requisite service period. We accountfor forfeitures when they occur.We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options, warrants, and SARs on the grant date. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires certain subjective inputs and assumptions, including the fair value of our common stock, the expected term, risk-free interestrates, expected stock price volatility, and expected dividend yield of our common stock.These assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\u2022Expected term. We estimate the expected term based on the simplified method for employees and on the contractual term for non-employees.\u2022Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free inter est rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\u2022Expected volatility.

Where, in some cases, our common share trading history is shorter thanthe expected term, we consider comparable publicly-traded companies in our industry group.\u2022Expected dividend yield.

QUANTITATIVE AND\n QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currencyrisk as follows:Interest Rate RiskOur exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities. The2025 and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan Facilities represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impactour consolidated financial statements. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on these loans. A hypothetical 100 basis pointincrease or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and decliningin periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $317 millionas of December 31, 2021.Investment RiskOur  investment  policy  objective  aims  to  preserve  capital  and  meet  liquidity  requirements  without  significantly  increasing  risk.  We  had  cash  and  cashequivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.4 billion and $7.8 billion as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Wedid not have any marketable debt securities classified as short-term investments as of December 31, 2021. Our cash and cash equivalents consist of money marketfunds and cash deposits. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest raterisk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change ininterest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.We are exposed to certain risk related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates andrecently public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult tovalue given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk.These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes inthe fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a setperiod of time after a public offering. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our investments was $12.6 billion, including equity method investments.Foreign Currency RiskWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us tothe risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operatingexpenses  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar.  Accordingly,  changes  in  exchange  rates  may  negatively  affect  our  future  revenue  and  otheroperating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar isdiversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurementof our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currencyrates may also impact the value of our equity method investment in our Yandex.Taxi joint venture. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter intoderivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.69", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4429, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d5bb3663-23e9-4572-9eb2-95b2b7441bc6": {"__data__": {"id_": "d5bb3663-23e9-4572-9eb2-95b2b7441bc6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "a96a866e-b0ef-4c35-ac68-b6ae839ab755", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "72", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "3615cc87e081fddfdda28fcaae578dd19bec2a8d74c6f8ddc01df28d0f153d4e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ITEM 8.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.As described in Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d) and TupeloParent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 because they were acquired by the Company inpurchase business combinations during 2021. We have also excluded Drizly and Transplace from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Drizly andTransplace are wholly-owned subsidiaries whose total assets and total revenues excluded from management\u2019s assessment and our audit of internal control overfinancial reporting collectively represent approximately 3% and 4%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the yearended December 31, 2021.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and thepreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financialreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactionsand  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (ii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financialstatements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance withauthorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding71", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3587, "end_char_idx": 6254, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3c415378-c625-4ea7-a8e8-4fd009dc99a5": {"__data__": {"id_": "3c415378-c625-4ea7-a8e8-4fd009dc99a5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1cfa463-69cf-4b5d-84c2-9b2be80f8805", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "433a1130ccc379f7cf39349c3ed77c07c4d96be9542b02953373ddace9babbfa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "35c26b48-e130-48f1-b1c1-96ba1ef026cf", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "3c243db3d263807080adc07e5af13003ab4460a5e7dd9b5e9e05fd07c647b550", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "prevention or timely de\ntection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.  Also,  projections  of  any  evaluation  ofeffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicatedor required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and(ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion onthe consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on thecritical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Presentation of Mobility and Delivery Revenue Agreements, Including Incentives, Discounts and Promotions to Drivers, Merchants and End-UsersAs described in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives its revenues principally from Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 use of theCompany\u2019s platform, on-demand lead generation, and related services in connection with Mobility and Delivery services, as well as from direct fees charged toend-users for use of the platform and in exchange for Delivery services. Management applies judgment in determining whether the Company is the principal oragent  in  transactions  with  Drivers,  Merchants  and  end-users.  This  determination  impacts  the  presentation  of  revenue  on  a  gross  or  net  basis  as  well  as  thepresentation of incentives provided to Drivers and Merchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users, to the extent they are not customers. For the yearended  December  31,  2021,  the  Company\u2019s  Mobility  and  Delivery  revenue,  net  of  incentives,  was  $15.3  billion  and  discounts,  loyalty  programs,  promotions,refunds, and credits provided to end-users who are not customers totaled $2.4 billion, of which a significant portion relates to discounts and promotions.The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the presentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue agreements, includingincentives, discounts and promotions to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in assessing thepresentation of revenue on a gross or net basis, as well as the presentation of incentives, discounts and promotions offered to Drivers, Merchants, and end-users,which  in  turn  led  to  a  high  degree  of  auditor  judgment,  subjectivity  and  effort  in  performing  procedures  and  evaluating  audit  evidence  relating  to  whethertransaction attributes were appropriately analyzed and presented by management.Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financialstatements.  These  procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to  the  Company\u2019s  revenue  recognition  process,  including  controls  over  thepresentation of Mobility and Delivery revenue, incentives, discounts and promotions. These procedures also included, among others, testing, on a sample basis, triptransaction attributes and assessing management\u2019s classification of new or changed agreements by examining documentation related to the agreement terms, driverstatements, rider receipts, and discount, promotion and incentive terms, and assessing the impact of those terms and attributes on the presentation of revenue andincome statement classification.Valuation of Insurance ReservesAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, insurance reserves is the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, which representsthe estimate of the ultimate unpaid obligation for risks retained by the Company and includes an amount for case reserves related to reported claims and an amountfor  losses  incurred  but  not  reported  as  of  the  balance  sheet  date.  The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied  to historical  claim  and loss experience.  In addition,  management  uses assumptions  based  on actuarial  judgment  related  to claim  and loss developmentpatterns  and  expected  loss  costs,  which  consider  frequency  trends,  severity  trends,  and  relevant  industry  data.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4988, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "35c26b48-e130-48f1-b1c1-96ba1ef026cf": {"__data__": {"id_": "35c26b48-e130-48f1-b1c1-96ba1ef026cf", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f1cfa463-69cf-4b5d-84c2-9b2be80f8805", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "433a1130ccc379f7cf39349c3ed77c07c4d96be9542b02953373ddace9babbfa", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "3c415378-c625-4ea7-a8e8-4fd009dc99a5", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "74", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "b195ec0f6efafe5d11de6ab060b4b25d4bcef107498a4e11d03d72709098d6be", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The  estimate  of  the  ultimate  unpaid  obligation  utilizes  generally  accepted  actuarial  methodsapplied  to historical  claim  and loss experience.

Significant Accounting PoliciesDescription of BusinessUber Technologies, Inc. (\u201cUber,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber isa technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (\u201cplatform(s)\u201d or \u201cPlatform(s)\u201d). Uber connectsconsumers  (\u201cRider(s)\u201d)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (\u201cMobility  Driver(s)\u201d)  for  ridesharing  services,  and  connects  Riders  and  other  consumers(\u201cEaters\u201d)  with restaurants,  grocers  and other stores (collectively,  \u201cMerchants\u201d)  with delivery  service  providers  (\u201cCouriers\u201d)  for meal  preparation,  grocery  andother delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as \u201cend-user(s)\u201d or \u201cconsumer(s).\u201d Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred toas \u201cDriver(s).\u201d Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and productexpertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies that will provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia(excluding China and Southeast Asia).Basis of PresentationThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States(\u201cGAAP\u201d). We consolidate our wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control, and variable interest entities (\u201cVIE\u201d)where  we  are  deemed  to  be  the  primary  beneficiary.  Refer  to  Note  16  \u2013  Variable  Interest  Entities  for  further  information.  All  intercompany  balances  andtransactions have been eliminated.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect thereported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions whichmanagement believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values ofinvestments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value ofacquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves;certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities;  insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actualresults could differ from those estimates. We considered the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the assumptions and inputs (including market data) supportingcertain  of  these  estimates,  assumptions  and  judgments,  in  particular,  our  impairment  assessment  related  to  the  determination  of  the  fair  values  of  certaininvestments and equity method investments as well as goodwill and the recoverability of long-lived assets. The level of uncertainties and volatility in the globalfinancial markets and economies resulting from the pandemic as well as the uncertainties related to the impact of the pandemic on us and our investees' operationsand financial performance means that these estimates may change in future periods, as new events occur and additional information is obtained.Concentration of Credit RiskCash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, and accounts receivable are potentially subject tocredit risk concentration. Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution orcommercial  issuer. Cash deposits  typically  exceed  insured  limits  and are  placed  with financial  institutions  around the  world that  we believe  are  of high creditquality. We have not experienced any material losses related to these concentrations during the periods presented. Our other receivables primarily consist of fundswithheld by well-established insurance companies with high credit quality that may be used to cover future settlement of reserved insurance claims. We rely on alimited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (\u201cpayment service providers\u201d) to collect amounts due from end-users.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5110, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6a470a0b-bab5-4b57-b731-974e7c09b05b": {"__data__": {"id_": "6a470a0b-bab5-4b57-b731-974e7c09b05b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3c030a04-8dba-4971-878a-b204d44af52d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "646aba3417bb431e382e69db601d84e4b74348d9296b0de6b8e428dfb97f80e7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "a3854df1-6d78-43d6-b1c0-f9ece9ca027b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "84", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "9d6b332a46b0983ff2df8a523ac0a09b9c02314a99adf8e0b8d572530e5014ad", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government andagency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities.

COVID-19  has  rapidly  impacted  market  and  economicconditions globally.

The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely onfuture developments, including: the duration of the spread of the outbreak (both globally and within the United States), including whether there will be furtherresurgences of the outbreak or variants of the virus; the distribution of vaccines in various regions; the impact on capital, foreign currencies exchange and financialmarkets; governmental or regulatory orders that impact our business; and whether the impacts may result in permanent changes to our end-users\u2019 behavior, all ofwhich are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash  and  cash  equivalents  consist  of  cash  held  in  checking  and  savings  accounts  as  well  as  investments  in  money  market  funds,  commercial  paper,  U.S.government  and  agency  securities,  and  corporate  bonds.

In addition, we capitalize interest incurred on outstanding debt during the period of construction-in-progress of certain assets.Leased vehicle assets are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. The vast majority of our leased vehicle assets were reclassified to assets held for saleas of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, an agreement was executed with Waydrive Holdings Pte. Ltd. (\u201cWaydrive\u201d) to purchase the Lion City Rentals Pte. Ltd.(\u201cLCR\u201d), a wholly-owned vehicle solutions subsidiary of ours based in Singapore. Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures for further information. When leased vehiclesare retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements ofoperations in the period realized. Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to operating expenses as incurred.84", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4475, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "56c459c3-5e75-4d0d-b205-6c0aa08ae8ec": {"__data__": {"id_": "56c459c3-5e75-4d0d-b205-6c0aa08ae8ec", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "26b6c4ab-da9d-4d1f-b8e8-064dd0d06adf", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "87", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "ab6a7002ca343db9f4f786ac191dab4e7b5e3664f37ba08fc1367d9777b96bc1", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "39dc0ece-b5c2-4f73-8174-9d6c5f61bc7f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d072860230c003dfa04f059aec9e855155f6d55240b934a48a34f8865c058115", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Leases\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 842, \u201cLeases\u201d (\u201cASC 842\u201d) on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition methodand used the effective date as the date of initial application. We elected the \u201cpackage of practical expedients,\u201d which permits us not to reassess under ASC 842 ourprior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. We made a policy election not to separate non-lease components from leasecomponents, therefore, we account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. We also elected the short-term lease recognition exemption forall leases that qualify.We determine if a contract contains a lease at inception of the arrangement based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economicbenefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to anasset  which  we  do  not  own.  Right  of  use  (\u201cROU\u201d)  assets  represent  our  right  to  use  an  underlying  asset  for  the  lease  term  and  lease  liabilities  represent  ourobligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilitiesare recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the futurelease  payments  is  our  incremental  borrowing  rate  (\u201cIBR\u201d),  because  the  interest  rate  implicit  in  most  of  our  leases  is  not  readily  determinable.  The  IBR  is  ahypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to thelease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixedpayments  or  in-substance  fixed  payments  are  included  in  our  lease  liability  calculation.  Variable  lease  payments  may  include  costs  such  as  common  areamaintenance, utilities, real estate taxes or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for thosepayments are incurred.Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current on our consolidatedbalance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, accrued and other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidatedbalance sheets. For operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis in operations over the lease term. For finance leases, lease expense isrecognized as depreciation and interest; depreciation on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest using the effective interest method.

If,  afterassessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount,then additional impairment testing is not required.

If the fair value exceeds book value,goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. However, if the book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairmentloss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.

We evaluate our non-marketable equity securities forimpairment at each reporting period based on a qualitative assessment that considers various potential impairment indicators. Impairment indicators might include,but would not necessarily be limited to, a significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, or business prospects of the investee, asignificant adverse change in the regulatory, economic, or technological environment of the investee, a bona fide offer to purchase, an offer by the investee to sell,or  a  completed  auction  process  for  the  same  or  similar  securities  for  an  amount  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investments  in  those  securities.

To determine the portion of a decline in fair value that is credit-related, we compare the present value of the expected cashflows of the security discounted at the security\u2019s effective interest rate to the amortized cost basis of the security. A credit-related impairment is limited to thedifference between fair value and amortized cost, and recognized as an allowance for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustmentto net income (loss). Any remaining decline in fair value that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.

This evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors including recent financialresults and operating trends of the investee; implied values in recent transactions of investee securities; other publicly available information that may affect thevalue of our investments.Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets for ImpairmentWe evaluate our held-and-used long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amountof an asset or asset group (collectively, the \u201casset group\u201d) may not be recoverable. We measure the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the carryingamount  of  such  asset  groups  to  the  future  undiscounted  cash  flows  it  expects  the  asset  group  to  generate.  If  we  consider  the  asset  group  to  be  impaired,  theimpairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds its fair value.Fair Value Measurements and Financial InstrumentsFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants atthe measurement date. In accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement (\u201cASC 820\u201d), we use the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used tomeasure fair value. The hierarchy, as defined below, gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and thelowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are set forth below:    Level 1    Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that arenot active or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly for the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3    Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.Our  primary  financial  instruments  include  cash  equivalents,  restricted  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  receivables,  investments,  accounts  payable,  accruedliabilities, long-term debt, and, prior to 2021, marketable debt securities, embedded derivatives and warrants.

These evaluations are complex,involve judgment, and the use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other factors. If we determine that anentity for which we hold a contractual or ownership interest in is a VIE and that we are the primary beneficiary, we consolidate such entity in the consolidatedfinancial  statements.  The  primary  beneficiary  of  a  VIE  is  the  party  that  meets  both  of  the  following  criteria:  (1)  has  the  power  to  make  decisions  that  mostsignificantly  affect  the  economic  performance  of  the  VIE;  and  (2)  has  the  obligation  to  absorb  losses  or  the  right  to  receive  benefits  that  in  either  case  couldpotentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, we determine whether any changes in the interest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination ofwhether we are still the primary beneficiary. If we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, we account for the investment or other variable interestsin a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.

The MSA defines the service fee we chargeDrivers and Merchants for each transaction. Upon acceptance of a transaction, Drivers and Merchants agree to perform the services as requested by an end-user.The acceptance of a transaction request combined with the MSA establishes enforceable rights and obligations for each transaction. A contract exists between usand the Drivers and Merchants after the Drivers and Merchants accept a transaction request and the Drivers\u2019 and Merchants\u2019 ability to cancel the transaction lapses.The Uber Service activities are performed to satisfy our sole performance obligation in the transaction, which is to connect Drivers and Merchants with end-users to facilitate the completion of a successful transaction.In 2020, we began charging Mobility end-users a fee to use the platform in certain markets. In these transactions, in addition to a performance obligation toDrivers, we also have a performance obligation to end-users, which is to connect end-users to Drivers in the marketplace. We recognize revenue when a trip iscomplete.  We  present  revenue  on  a  net  basis  for  these  transactions,  as  we  do  not  control  the  service  provided  by  Drivers  to  end-users.  For  the  years  endedDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, we recognized total revenue of $323 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these fees charged to end-users.Additionally, during the first quarter of 2020, we modified our arrangements in certain markets and as a result, concluded we are responsible for deliveryservices to end-users in those markets. We have determined that in these transactions, Merchants and end-users are our customers and revenue from these contractsshall be recognized separately for each under ASC 606. We recognize delivery service revenue associated with our performance obligation over the contract term,which represents its performance over the period of time the delivery is occurring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized revenue from end-usersof $91 million and cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization of $439 million associated with these delivery transactions. For the year endedDecember  31,  2021,  we  recognized  revenue  from  end-users  of  $710  million  and  cost  of  revenue,  exclusive  of  depreciation  and  amortization  of  $2.4  billionassociated with these delivery transactions.In all markets aside from the above two scenarios, end-users access the platform for free and we have no performance obligation to end-users. As a result, thisclass of end-users are not our customers.Principal vs. Agent ConsiderationsJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or agent in transactions with Drivers, Merchants and end-users. We evaluate the presentationof revenue on a gross or net basis based on whether we control the service provided to the end-user and are the principal (i.e. \u201cgross\u201d), or we arrange for otherparties to provide the service to the end-user and are an agent (i.e. \u201cnet\u201d). This determination also impacts the presentation of incentives provided to Drivers andMerchants and discounts and promotions offered to end-users to the extent they are not customers.For  the  majority  of  Mobility  and  Delivery  transactions,  our  role  is  to  provide  the  Uber  Service  to  Drivers  and Merchants  to  facilitate  a  successful  trip  orDelivery service to end-users.

In markets where we earn the difference between the amount paid by an end-user and the amount earned byDrivers, end-users are quoted a fixed upfront price for ridesharing services while we pay Drivers based on actual time and distance for the ridesharing servicesprovided.

New Mobility refers to offerings and products that provided users access to rides through a varietyof modes, including dockless e-bikes and e-scooters (\u201cNew Mobility\u201d). Users contracted with us via a rental agreement at the inception of each trip. We wereresponsible for providing access to the e-bikes and e-scooters over the user\u2019s desired period of use. We recorded lease payments received upon completion of eachtrip. After the JUMP Divestiture during the second quarter of 2020, revenue from New Mobility products, including dockless e-bikes, was no longer material.Refer to Note 19 \u2013 Divestitures for further information on the JUMP Divestiture.Advanced Technologies Group (\u201cATG\u201d) and Other Technology Programs Collaboration RevenueIn 2019, we entered into a three-year joint collaboration agreement with certain third parties to develop next\u2013generation self-driving technology. Under thiscollaboration agreement, we received cash consideration over the three-year term. We have applied ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements for recognition andpresentation of the consideration received as collaboration revenue. Refer to Note 17 \u2013 Non-Controlling Interests for further information.Incentives to CustomersIncentives provided to customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue if we do not receive a distinct good or service or cannot reasonably estimate the fairvalue  of  the  good  or  service  received.  Incentives  to  customers  that  are  not  provided  in  exchange  for  a  distinct  good  or  service  are  evaluated  as  variableconsideration, in the most likely amount to be earned by the customer at the time or as they are earned by customers, depending on the type of incentive. Sinceincentives are earned over a short period of time, there is limited uncertainty when estimating variable consideration.Incentives earned by customers for referring new customers are paid in exchange for a distinct service and are accounted for as customer acquisition costs. Weexpense such referral payments as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We apply the practical expedient underASC  340-40-25-4  and  expense  costs  to  acquire  new  customer  contracts  as  incurred  because  the  amortization  period  would  be  one  year  or  less.  The  amountrecorded as an expense is the lesser of the amount of the incentive paid or the established fair value of the service received. Fair value of the service is establishedusing amounts paid to vendors for similar services. The amounts paid to customers presented as sales and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31,2019, 2020 and 2021 were immaterial.In  some  transactions,  incentives  and  payments  made  to  customers  may  exceed  the  revenue  earned  in  the  transaction.  In  these  transactions,  the  resultingshortfall amount is recorded as a reduction of revenue.Advertising RevenueWe derive the majority of our advertising revenue from sponsored listing fees paid by merchants and brands in exchange for advertising on our platform.Advertising revenue is recognized when an end-user engages with the sponsored listing based on the number of clicks.

We elected the tax law ordering approach in assessing the realizability of net operating losses expected to offset future GlobalIntangible Low-taxed Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d).We have elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost.The establishment of deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers of intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions todetermine the fair value of such intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing intangible assets may include, but are not necessarily limited to, internal revenueand expense forecasts, the estimated life of the intangible assets, comparable transaction values, and/or discount rates. The discount rates used to discount expectedfuture cash flows to present value are derived from a weighted-average cost of capital analysis and are adjusted to reflect the inherent risks related to the cash flow.Although we believe the assumptions and estimates utilized are reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience, internal and externalcomparable  data  and  are  inherently  uncertain.

The two-class method requires income available tocommon stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as ifall income for the period had been distributed.Our restricted common stock, and common stock issued upon early exercise of stock options are participating securities. We consider restricted common stockand any shares issued upon early exercise of stock options, subject to repurchase, to be participating securities because holders of such shares have non-forfeitabledividend rights in the event a cash dividend is declared on common stock.Prior  to  conversion  to  common  stock  upon  our  IPO,  the  holders  of  the  redeemable  convertible  preferred  stock  would  have  been  entitled  to  dividends  inpreference to common shareholders, at specified rates, if declared.

These observed inputswere considered indicative of changes in the fair value of the Grab securities. Using the analysis, we computed a downward market adjustment of 10% that wasapplied  to  the  valuation  derived  from  Grab\u2019s  latest  financing  transaction  which  occurred  earlier  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  and  prior  to  the  announcement  ofCOVID-19  as  a  global  pandemic,  impacting  global  demand  for  Mobility  services.  As  a  result,  the  carrying  value  of  the  investment  in  Grab  was  reduced  by$230 million; $57 million reduced the previously recognized unrealized gain in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and the remaining $173 million,representing the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the securities, was recognized as an allowance for credit loss in the consolidated balancesheet  and  a  corresponding  credit-related  impairment  charge  recorded  to  other  income  (expense),  net  in  the  consolidated  statement  of  operations.  Due  to  thesignificant  uncertainty  about Grab\u2019s ability  to repay the redemption  amount of the securities  on the redemption date, the amount expected to be collected  wasconsidered to be less than the fair value of the securities. Therefore, during the first quarter of 2020, the entire decline in fair value below amortized cost wasconsidered to reflect a credit-related impairment charge.The fair value of our Grab investment recovered during the third quarter of 2020 as determined by referencing an equity financing transaction closed by theinvestee during that quarter.

The  CSE  method  assumes  an  if-converted  scenario,  where  the  OPM  approach  allocates  equity  value  to  individualsecurities  within  the  investees\u2019  capital  structure  based  on  contractual  rights  and  preferences.  We  computed  a  range  of  market  adjustments  based  on  observedmarket valuation declines of Didi\u2019s representative stock market indices and publicly-traded competitive peer group since the latest transaction in similar securitiesoccurred in the prior year and prior to the announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, impacting global demand for ridesharing services. These inputs areconsidered indicative of changes in the fair value of Didi equity. Market adjustments within the range were applied to the Didi equity valuation derived from thelatest financing transaction in similar securities which were then used in the CSE and OPM approaches to obtain the fair value of the Didi securities owned by us.A lower adjustment within the range was applied to the enterprise value used in the CSE allocation compared to a higher downward adjustment for purposes ofallocating value in the OPM approach. The value adjustment differential was attributable to several factors including possible exit scenarios, as an IPO event wouldresult  in  higher  valuation  (due  to  access  to  public  markets  and  reduction  in  cost  of  capital),  reduces  valuation  uncertainty,  and  generally  assumes  market  andmacro-economic conditions that are comparatively more favorable than an otherwise prolonged stay-private scenario. As a result of the valuation performed, werecorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020. There wasno remeasurement event for our investment in Didi that occurred during the remainder of 2020.The following table summarizes information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation for our investment in Didi as of March 31, 2020:Fair value methodKey unobservable input CSEMarket adjustment (20)% OPMVolatility 39% Estimated time to liquidity2.0 years Market adjustment(40)% During the first quarter of 2021, we completed the sale of $500 million of our Didi shares and realized immaterial gains from this transaction.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4464, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a96be17e-f894-4def-a461-d70808d44931": {"__data__": {"id_": "a96be17e-f894-4def-a461-d70808d44931", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "32818168-e285-46e9-b57f-9aadc14e835c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "22a131cac60087d377961487927bde19ccca21625768de35a38e0e5863b3271e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5a6b0a3-da59-432c-8e2a-20ca6575c49c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "uber_2021.pdf", "file_path": "data/10k/uber_2021.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 1880483, "creation_date": "2024-11-23", "last_modified_date": "2024-11-23"}, "hash": "581e6ee3b354b00273719f8356c60f245be84980ee363c741ebdda15ff9e8f83", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "As a result of the valuation performed, werecorded an impairment charge of $1.7 billion in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of 2020.

In  exchange  for  consideration  contributed,  wereceived a seat on MLU B.V.\u2019s board and an initial 38% equity ownership interest consisting of common stock in MLU B.V. Certain contingent equity issuancesof MLU B.V. may dilute our equity ownership interest to approximately 33%. The investment was determined to be an equity method investment due to our abilityto exercise significant influence over MLU B.V. The initial fair value of our equity method investment in MLU B.V. was estimated using discounted cash flows ofMLU B.V. The equity ownership interest in MLU B.V. was 35% and 29% as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.2020During 2020, Yandex contributed its Yandex.Carsharing business (\u201cDrive\u201d) into MLU B.V. in exchange for an additional equity interest. The contribution ofDrive into MLU B.V. resulted in the dilution of our ownership in MLU B.V. from 38% to 35%. The gain recognized on the dilution of our interest was not materialto our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. As part of this transaction, MLU B.V. contributed the assets and liabilities of itsautonomous driving unit into a new legal entity, Yandex Self Driving Group B.V. (\u201cSDG\u201d), in which Yandex contributed additional capital. The reduction of ourownership interest to 20% in SDG, initially valued at $42 million, did not result in a material dilution gain.2021On August 30, 2021, we entered into an agreement with Yandex (the \u201cFramework Agreement\u201d) to restructure our joint ventures, MLU B.V. and SDG and wewould sell to Yandex (i) our 4.5% equity interest in MLU B.V. and (ii) our entire equity interest in SDG (the \u201cInitial Closing\u201d).

As a result, we derecognized our entire equity interest in the Demerged Businesses and recognized again of $242 million in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations.MLU B.V. Call OptionThe MLU B.V. Call Option is recorded as a liability in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, initially valued at $230 millionand measured at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. Theexercise  price  of  the  MLU  B.V.  Call  Option  is  approximately  $1.8  billion,  subject  to  certain  adjustments  based  on  the  timing  of  the  option  exercise.  As  ofDecember 31, 2021, the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option is $193 million, including the recognition of an immaterial gain for the fair value change duringthe year ended December 31, 2021. To determine the fair value of the MLU B.V. Call Option as of December 31, 2021, we used a lattice model which simulatedmultiple scenarios of the exercise behaviors and the corresponding strike prices over the term of the call option. Key inputs to the lattice model were underlyingbusiness value, option term of 1.7 years, volatility of 50%, risk-free interest rates, and strike price (Level 3).MLU B.V. Basis DifferenceIncluded in the carrying value of MLU B.V. is the basis difference, net of amortization, between the original cost of the investment and our proportionateshare of the net assets of MLU B.V. The carrying value of the equity method investment is primarily adjusted for our share in the income or losses of MLU B.V.and amortization of basis differences. Equity method goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization are also adjusted for currency translationadjustments representing fluctuations between the functional currency of the investee, the Ruble and the U.S. Dollar.The table below provides the composition of the basis difference as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):As of December 31, 2021 Equity method goodwill$ 545 Intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization54 Deferred tax liabilities(12) Cumulative currency translation adjustments(107) Basis difference$ 480 We amortize the basis difference related to the intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets that gave rise to the difference using the straight-line method. The weighted-average life of the intangible assets is approximately 4.0 years and 3.3 years as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Equitymethod  goodwill  is not  amortized.  The  investment  balance  is reviewed  for  impairment  whenever  factors  indicate  that  the  carrying  value  of the  equity  methodinvestment may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, we determined that there was no impairment of our investment in MLU B.V. The futureeffect of the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions as well as other factors will continue to be monitored.Mission Bay 3 & 4The Mission Bay 3 & 4 JV refers to Event Center Office Partners, LLC (\u201cECOP\u201d), a joint venture entity established in 2018, by Uber and two companies(\u201cLLC Partners\u201d) to manage the construction and operation of two office buildings owned by two ECOP wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Fair value was determined by referencing market valuation multiples implied by companiesthat have comparable businesses which is a Level 3 measurement. The carrying value of our New Mobility reporting unit exceeded its fair value, and as a result, agoodwill impairment charge of $100 million was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations after consideration ofimpairments of long-lived and other assets of the reporting unit.

The difference of $243 million between the principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes and the liabilitycomponent (the \u201cdebt discount\u201d) was amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The equitycomponent  of  the  2025  Convertible  Notes  was  included  in  additional  paid-in  capital  in  the  consolidated  balance  sheet  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  was  notremeasured as it continued to meet the conditions for equity classification. To determine the fair value of the liability component of the 2025 Convertible Notes asof the pricing date, we used the binomial model with inputs of time to maturity, conversion ratio, our stock price, risk free rate and volatility.Effective January 1, 2021, we early adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard resulted in a decrease toadditional paid-in capital of $243 million and an increase to our 2025 Convertible Notes by the same amount. At adoption, there was no adjustment recorded to theopening accumulated deficit. As a result of the adoption, starting on January 1, 2021 interest expense is reduced as a result of accounting for the 2025 ConvertibleNotes as a single liability measured at its amortized cost.The fair value of our 2025 Convertible Notes was $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are notactive, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.Senior NotesIn October 2018, we issued five-year notes with aggregate principal amount of $500 million due on November 1, 2023 (the \u201c2023 Senior Notes\u201d) and eight-year  notes  with  aggregate  principal  amount  of  $1.5  billion  due  on  November  1,  2026  (the  \u201c2026  Senior  Notes\u201d)  in  a  private  placement  offering  totaling  $2.0billion.

The current year tax expense and any subsequent changes in the recognition ormeasurement of this deferred tax liability will be recorded in continuing operations.Based on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions\u2019 deferredtax assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferredtax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporarydifferences  and  tax  planning  strategies  by  jurisdiction.  Our  judgment  regarding  future  profitability  may  change  due  to  many  factors,  including  future  marketconditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred taxassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed. We had a valuation allowance against net deferredtax  assets  of  $13.4  billion  and  $13.9  billion  as  of  December  31,  2020  and  2021,  respectively.  In  2021,  the  increase  in  the  valuation  allowance  was  primarilyattributable to a tax rate increase in the Netherlands, an increase in U.S. federal, state and Netherlands deferred tax assets resulting from the loss from operations,and  tax  credits  generated  during  the  year,  offset  partially  by  the  release  of  the  valuation  allowance  due  to  deferred  tax  liabilities  recorded  as  a  result  of  theacquisitions providing an additional source of taxable income to support the realizability of pre-existing deferred tax assets.The  indefinite  carryforward  period  for  net  operating  losses  (\"NOLs\")  means  that  indefinite-lived  deferred  tax  liabilities  can  be  considered  as  support  forrealization of deferred tax assets, which can affect the need to record or maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021,we realized approximately $744 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets as a result of our indefinite-lived deferredtax liabilities being used as a source of income.As  of  December  31,  2021,  we  had  U.S.  federal  NOL  carryforwards  of  $3.2  billion  that  begin  to  expire  in  2031  and  $11.7  billion  that  have  an  unlimitedcarryover period.

We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative andaudit  proceedings,  asserting  claims  by  or  on  behalf  of  Drivers  that  Drivers  are  misclassified  as  independent  contractors.  In  connection  with  the  enactment  ofCalifornia State Assembly Bill 5 (\u201cAB5\u201d), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number ofmisclassification claims.

The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.

AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the\u201cABC\u201d test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workersperforming  services  for  a  hiring  entity  are  considered  employees  unless  the  hiring  entity  can  demonstrate  three  things:  the  worker  (A)  is  free  from  the  hiringentity\u2019s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity\u2019s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work ortype of business performed for the hiring entity.On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint inSan Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (\u201cLyft\u201d). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damagesrelated to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violatingvarious wage and hour laws.

We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals. In April 2021, aruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Raiser OperationsB.V. are still  pending for  years  2014 to 2019. In January  2022, the  Social Security  Tribunal  of Zurich  reclassified  drivers  who have  used the App in 2014 asdependent workers of Uber BV and Rasier Operations BV from a social security standpoint, but this ruling has been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and hasno impact on our current operations.

Webelieve that our current and historical approach to classification is supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.However, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, couldhave a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of thesematters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and otherfactors.State Unemployment TaxesIn  2018,  the  New  Jersey  Department  of  Labor  (\u201cNJDOL\u201d)  opened  an  audit  reviewing  whether  Drivers  were  independent  contractors  or  employees  forpurposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019,against both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interestsowed from 2014 through 2018.

Levandowski & Ron; Google v. LevandowskiOn October 28, 2016, Google filed arbitration demands against each of Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron, former employees of Google, alleging breach oftheir  respective  employment  agreements  with  Google,  fraud  and  other  state  law  violations  (due  to  soliciting  Google  employees  and  starting  a  new  venture  tocompete with Google\u2019s business in contravention of their respective employment agreements). Google sought damages, injunctive relief, and restitution. On March26, 2019, following a hearing, the arbitration panel issued an interim award, finding against each of Google\u2019s former employees and awarding $127 million againstAnthony Levandowski and $1 million for which both Anthony Levandowski and Lior Ron are jointly and severally liable. In July 2019, Google submitted itsrequest for interest, attorneys fees, and costs related to these claims. The Panel\u2019s Final Award was issued on December 6, 2019. On February 7, 2020, Ron andGoogle entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release to satisfy the corrected final award in the amount of approximately $10 million. Uber paid Googleon behalf of Ron pursuant to an indemnification obligation. A dispute continues to exist with regard to Uber\u2019s alleged indemnification obligation to Levandowski.Whether Uber is ultimately responsible for indemnification of Levandowski depends on the exceptions and conditions set forth in the indemnification agreement.In March 2020, Levandowski pleaded guilty to criminal trade secret charges and filed for bankruptcy. Former President Trump pardoned Levandowski from thetrade secret conviction. Uber filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, and Levandowski additionally asserted a claim against Uber alleging that Uber failed toperform its obligations under an agreement with Otto Trucking, LLC.

The subject matter of these contingent liabilities and non-income tax audits primarily arises from our transactions with Drivers, as well asthe tax treatment of certain employee benefits and related employment taxes. In jurisdictions with disputes connected to transactions with Drivers, disputes involvethe  applicability  of  transactional  taxes  (such  as  sales,  value  added  and  similar  taxes)  to  services  provided,  as  well  as  the  applicability  of  withholding  tax  onpayments made to such Drivers.We are involved in a proceeding in the UK involving HMRC, the tax regulator in the UK, which is seeking to classify us as a transportation provider. Beingclassified  as  a  transportation  provider  would  result  in  a  VAT  (20%)  on  Gross  Bookings  or  on  the  service  fee  that  we  charge  Drivers,  both  retroactively  andprospectively. HMRC is considering a number of factors including our contractual Driver, Rider and intercompany arrangements, and HMRC is also expected toconsider the U.K. Supreme Court\u2019s February 19, 2021 ruling on Drivers\u2019 worker classification, in determining whether we should be classified as a provider oftransportation services. HMRC may update its assessment, which we would then review and discuss with HMRC. If we do not reach a satisfactory resolution afterexhausting HMRC\u2019s review and appeals process, we would still be able to argue our case anew in the U.K. Tax Court, which may require the up-front payment tothe Tax Court (\u201cpay-to-play\u201d) of any final HMRC assessment to be held in escrow.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the minority common stockholdersownership in Freight Holding is classified as a redeemable non-controlling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in our control.We attribute the pro rata share of the Freight Holding\u2019s net income or loss available to holders of common stock to the redeemable non-controlling interestsgenerated from common shares of Freight Holding based on the outstanding ownership of the minority shareholders of common shares during the period.Freight Series A Preferred StockIn October 2020, Freight Holding entered into a 2020 Freight Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with a 2020 Freight Series A Investor.

The Initial CornershopInvestment was remeasured immediately prior to the acquisition of CS-Global, and based on the Cornershop business value and Uber\u2019s pre-acquisition ownershippercentage, the new value was not materially  different from the previously recognized amount. Thus, the Initial Cornershop Investment was determined at theoriginal $50 million. In exchange for the consideration transferred, we received 15,642,523 Preferred C Membership Interests in CS-Global, representing 55% ofthe  outstanding  membership  interests.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that wefile or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timeperiods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule13a-15(b)  under  the  Exchange  Act,  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer,  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  ourdisclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief ExecutiveOfficer  and  Chief  Financial  Officer  concluded  that,  as  of  the  end  of  the  period  covered  by  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K,  our  disclosure  controls  andprocedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.Changes in Internal Control over Financial ReportingThere were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected,or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controlover financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, ourmanagement does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that itsobjectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all controlissues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under theExchange Act). Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in\u201cInternal Control - Integrated Framework\u201d (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d). Based on thatassessment,  our  management  has  concluded  that  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  effective  as  of  December  31,  2021.  In  addition,PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, provided an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting asof December 31, 2021. You can find the full text of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP attestation report in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.In accordance with guidance from the staff of the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control overfinancial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management\u2019s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded theinternal control activities of The Drizly Group, Inc. (\u201cDrizly\u201d), which we acquired in October 2021 and Tupelo Parent, Inc. (\u201cTransplace\u201d), which we acquired inNovember 2021, as discussed in Note 18 \u2013 Business Combinations, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. We have included the financial results ofthese in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. Total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and total revenues related toDrizly and Transplace that were excluded from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting collectively represented approximately 3% and 4% ofour consolidated total assets and total revenues as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, respectively.ITEM 9B.
