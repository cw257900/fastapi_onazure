  page_content: International IDEA  51. Introduction 1. Introduction The vast majority of contemporary constitutions describe the basic principles of  the state, the structures and processes of government and the fundamental rights   of citizens in a higher law that cannot be unilaterally changed by an ordinary   legislative act. This higher law is usually referred to as a constitution . The content and nature of a particular constitution, as well as how it relates to  the rest of the legal and political order, varies considerably between countries, and  there is no universal and uncontested definition of a constitution. Nevertheless,   any broadly accepted working definition of a constitution would likely describe it  as a set of fundamental legal- political rules that: 1.are binding on everyone in the state, including ordinary law-making   institutions; 2.concern the structure and operation of the institutions of government,   political principles and the rights of citizens; 3.are based on widespread public legitimacy; 4.are harder to change than ordinary laws (e.g. a two-thirds majority vote or   a referendum is needed); and 5.as a minimum, meet the internationally recognized criteria for a   democratic system in terms of representation and human rights.

(Note: Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution was modified by  the 25th Amendment.)   SECTION  1  In case of the removal of the President from office or of  his death or resignation, the Vice Presid ent shall become  President.   SECTION  2  Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice Presi -  dent, the President shall nominate a Vice President who  shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of  both Houses of Congress.   SECTION  3  Whenever  the President transmits to the President pro  tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of  Representatives  his written  declaration  that he is unable  to discharge the powers and duties of his office, and until  he transmits to them a written declara tion to the contrary,  such powers and duties shall be discharged by the Vice President as Acting President.   SECTION  4  Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the  House of Representativ es their written declaration that the  President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of   his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the  powers and duties of the office as Acting President.  Thereafter, when the President transmits to the President   pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of  Representatives his written declaration that no inability ex -  ists, he shall resume the powers and duties of his office un-   less the Vice Pr esident and a majority of either the principal  officers of the executive department or of such other body   as Congress may by law provide, transmit within four days   to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker  of the House of Representatives t heir written declaration   that the President is unable to discharge the powers and  duties of his office. Thereupon Congress shall decide the  issue,  assembling  within  forty-eight  hours  for that purpose  if not in session. If the Congress, within twenty -one da ys  after receipt of the latter written declaration, or, if Congress   is not in session, within twenty -one days after Congress is  required to assemble, determines by two -thirds vote of both  Houses that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duti es of his office, the Vice President shall continue to  discharge the same as Acting President; otherwise, the Presi -  dent shall resume the powers and duties of his office.

  page_content: International IDEA  112. The fundamentals of constitutions 3.Fundamental rights: a list of rights, including their applicability,   enforcement, limitations, suspension or restriction during a state of   emergency. 4.Social and economic rights or policy directives. 5.Parliament or legislature: its structure, composition, terms of office,   privileges, procedures and so on. 6.Head of state: the method of selection, powers, terms of office. 7.Government (in a parliamentary or semi-presidential system): government   formation rules, responsibility, powers. 8.Judiciary: Court system, judicial appointments, judicial independence,   public prosecutors. 9.Sub-national government: federal or devolved powers, local government. 10.Provisions for referendums. 11.Institutions of the 'fourth branch' or integrity branch (e.g. electoral   commission, ombudsman, auditors). 12.Security sector: commander-in-chief, any restrictions on military power. 13.Other miscellaneous provisions: special provisions for particular groups,   language laws or institutions. 14.Amendment procedures, implementation timetable and transitionary   provisions. Box 2.1. Reading between the lines The constitutional order can include, in addition to the constitutional text itself, other written legal   or quasi- legal instruments with constitutional significance. These may typically include electoral   laws, laws on party financing, laws on judicial appointments and on the organization of the courts,   international treaties, the standing orders of parliament and judicial decisions (Palmer 2006).      The constitutional order may also include unwritten —and legally unenforceable —rules that are  nevertheless regarded by all constitutional actors as politically binding (King 2001). In Canada, for  example, ‘the conventions of Cabinet government’ and the ‘firm, though unwritten rule that the  government must hold the support of a majority in the House of Commons’ are not mentioned in the  constitutional text but are well established in the conventional practice of the Canadian   constitutional order (Van Loon and Whittington 1987: 172).

  page_content: International IDEA  153. Constitutions and democracy Democratic constitutionalism as a global norm Modern democratic constitutionalism is based on two principles: (a) representative   government , enabling citizens to participate in public affairs and hold their  government to account; and (b) the protection of rights (especially the due process   of law, freedom of speech and religious tolerance), through which citizens are  insulated from abuses of power. These principles of representative government and the protection of rights can  be expressed in terms of inclusivity and contestation (Dahl 1973), notions that  have gradually broadened and deepened over time. During the 19th and early  20th centuries, the right to participate in public affairs was extended, usually after  long and sometimes violent struggles, to all men, and finally to women as well.  New forms of public participation were also developed or popularized during the  20th century, such as proportional electoral systems and mechanisms of direct   democracy. Similarly, during the 20th century, the rights provisions of new  constitutions typically became: (a) more expansive , with economic, social, cultural   and environmental rights being increasingly recognized in addition to the basic   civil and legal rights of earlier texts; and (b) more directly enforceable , with an  expanded role for independent judiciaries in upholding them. Modern democratic constitutionalism has spread around the world in  subsequent waves of democratization. During the second half of the 20th century,   it successfully took root in many parts of the world beyond its old North Atlantic   and Western European core. Democratic constitutionalism is now embedded in  the most widely recognized international declarations and conventions, including   the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the International   Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966). The list of states with credible   claims to having a stable and sustainable democratic constitutional order now  includes countries on all continents and in all regions of the world. Whatever it once was, democratic constitutionalism is now a universal value,   and its benefits can, at least potentially, be shared by all of humanity (Sen 1999). Elite accommodation Establishing a democratic constitutional order is not easy. Throughout history,   only a minority of states have succeeded. Those who set themselves the task of  establishing such a constitutional order must be mindful of the social and  political, as well as the technical and legal, challenges they face. In almost every human society a  relatively small elite possesses both wealth and  power in abundance, while a  much larger number of non-elite people do not.  What distinguishes the elite from the non-elite, in constitution- building terms, is  access to economic and political power: elites rule, non-elites are ruled.

  page_content: 10   International IDEAWhat is a Constitution? Principles and Concepts societal goals that public authorities must strive to achieve. This is reflected in the  emphasis placed on the constitution’s  social content and in the ideological shape   of its legal and political content. A prescriptive constitution may be appropriate in cases where a society wishes   to re-establish itself on a shared ethical basis that is both symbolically proclaimed   by, and practically embedded in, its supreme law. South Africa (1996) and  Ecuador (2008) provide examples of prescriptive constitutions. It should be remembered that these archetypes are not firm categorizations.   Most constitutions contain, to varying degrees, both features. According to South   African Constitutional Court Justice Albie Sachs, constitutions can be regarded as  ‘autobiographies  of nations’ (Austin  2009). Even a relatively thin procedural   constitution will say something about how a society sees itself and about who is  included in and who is excluded from the nation’s  self-narrative. Moreover, in  some countries, this autobiographical function is not confined to the constitution   as such. It may also be performed by a separate pre-constitutional or extra-   constitutional text, such as a declaration of independence or a republic   proclamation, which is not part of the legal order of the state but has an  important role in maintaining social and political norms. What does a constitution typically contain? Divisions Most constitutions are divided and sub-divided into parts that may variously be  known as titles, chapters, articles, sections, paragraphs or clauses. Arrangement Constitutions vary in the arrangement of their provisions, although it is now  usual for principles and rights provisions to be placed in a separate section near  the beginning of the text, for the main institutional provisions to be grouped in  the middle of the text, and for independent institutions, miscellaneous provisions   and amendments to be placed near the end of the text. The layout of a typical constitution might resemble the following: 1.Preamble: a statement of the overarching motives and goals of the   constitution-making exercise, sometimes referring to important historical   events, national identity or values. 2.Preliminaries: a declaration of sovereignty or of basic principles of   government; the name and territory of the state; citizenship and franchise;   state ideology, values or objectives.
